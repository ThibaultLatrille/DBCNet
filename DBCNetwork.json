      "abstract": "Purpose: To identify novel susceptibility loci for retinal vascular tortuosity, to better understand the molecular mechanisms modulating this trait, and reveal causal relationships with diseases and their risk factors. Design: Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) of vascular tortuosity of retinal arteries and veins fol- lowed by replication meta-analysis and Mendelian randomization (MR). Participants: We analyzed 116 639 fundus images of suitable quality from 63 662 participants from 3 co- horts, namely the UK Biobank (n 1\u20444 62 751), the Swiss Kidney Project on Genes in Hypertension (n 1\u20444 397), and OphtalmoLaus (n 1\u20444 512). Methods: Using a fully automated retina image processing pipeline to annotate vessels and a deep learning algorithm to determine the vessel type, we computed the median arterial, venous and combined vessel tortuosity measured by the distance factor (the length of a vessel segment over its chord length), as well as by 6 alternative measures that integrate over vessel curvature. We then performed the largest GWAS of these traits to date and assessed gene set enrichment using the novel high-precision statistical method PascalX. Main Outcome Measure: We evaluated the genetic association of retinal tortuosity, measured by the dis- tance factor. Results: Higher retinal tortuosity was significantly associated with higher incidence of angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and hypertension. We identified 175 significantly associated genetic loci in the UK Biobank; 173 of these were novel and 4 replicated in our second, much smaller, metacohort. We estimated heritability at w25% using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Vessel type specific GWAS revealed 116 loci for arteries and 63 for veins. Genes with significant association signals included COL4A2, ACTN4, LGALS4, LGALS7, LGALS7B, TNS1, MAP4K1, EIF3K, CAPN12, ECH1, and SYNPO2. These tortuosity genes were overexpressed in arteries and heart muscle and linked to pathways related to the structural properties of the vasculature. We demon- strated that retinal tortuosity loci served pleiotropic functions as cardiometabolic disease variants and risk factors. Concordantly, MR revealed causal effects between tortuosity, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein. Conclusions: Several alleles associated with retinal vessel tortuosity suggest a common genetic architecture of this trait with ocular diseases (glaucoma, myopia), cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. Our results shed new light on the genetics of vascular diseases and their pathomechanisms and highlight how GWASs and heritability can be used to improve phenotype extraction from high-dimensional data, such as images.",

      "abstract": "Proximal genetic variants are frequently correlated, implying that the corresponding effect sizes detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are also not independent. Methods already exist to account for this when aggregating effects from a single GWAS across genes or pathways. Here we present a rigorous yet fast method for detecting genes with coherent association signals for two traits, facilitating cross-GWAS analyses. To this end, we devised a new significance test for the covariance of datapoints not drawn independently but with a known inter-sample covariance structure. We show that the distribution of its test statistic is a linear combination of \u03c72 distributions with positive and negative coefficients. The corresponding cumulative distribution function can be efficiently calculated with Davies\u2019 algorithm at high precision. We apply this general framework to test for dependence between SNP-wise effect sizes of two GWAS at the gene level. We extend this test to detect also gene-wise causal links. We demonstrate the utility of our method by uncovering potential shared genetic links between the severity of COVID-19 and (1) being prescribed class M05B medication (drugs affecting bone structure and mineralization), (2) rheumatoid arthritis, (3) vitamin D (25OHD), and (4) serum calcium concentrations. Our method detects a potential role played by chemokine receptor genes linked to TH1 versus TH2 immune response, a gene related to integrin beta-1 cell surface expression, and other genes potentially impacting the severity of COVID-19. Our approach will be useful for similar analyses involving datapoints with known auto-correlation structures.",

Using a fully automated image processing pipeline, we extracted 17 different morphological vascular phenotypes, including median vessels diameter, diameter variability, main temporal angles, vascular density, central retinal equivalents, the number of bifurcations, and tortuosity, from over 130k fundus images of close to 72k UK Biobank subjects. We performed Genome-Wide Association Studies of these phenotypes. From this, we estimated their heritabilities, ranging between 5 and 25%, and genetic cross-phenotype correlations, which mostly mirrored the corresponding phenotypic correlations, but tended to be slightly larger. Projecting our genetic association signals onto genes and pathways revealed remarkably low overlap suggesting largely decoupled mechanisms modulating the different phenotypes. Our disease phenotype associations confirmed some previously known findings and revealed many novel connections. Notably, diameter variability, especially for the veins, seems to have new and interesting associations with diseases, including heart attack, pulmonary embolism, and age of death. Mendelian Randomization analysis suggests a causal influence of blood pressure and body mass index on retinal vessel morphology, among other results. We validated key findings in two independent smaller cohorts. Our analyses provide evidence that large-scale analysis of image-derived vascular phenotypes has sufficient power for obtaining functional, as well as some initial causal insights into the processes modulating the retinal vasculature.",

In the present study, by comparing chromatin structure and H3K27ac levels in normal and lymphoma B cells, we show that enhancer\u2013promoter-interacting regions assume different conformations according to the local abundance of H3K27ac. Genetic or pharmacological depletion of H3K27ac decreases the frequency and the spreading of these interactions, altering oncogene expression. Moreover, enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal translocations influences the epigenetic status of the regions flanking the breakpoint, prompting the formation of distinct intrachromosomal interactions in the two homologous chromosomes. These interactions are accompanied by allele-specific gene expression changes. Overall, our work indicates that H3K27ac dynamics modulates interaction frequency between regulatory regions and can lead to allele-specific chromatin configurations to sustain oncogene expression.",

      "abstract": "Chromatin folding in the 3D space of the nucleus can be explored through high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) approaches. These experiments quantify the number of interactions between any pair of genomic loci in the genome and, thus, allow building genome-scale maps of intra- and inter-chromosomal contacts (contact maps). Statistical and algorithmic analyses of Hi-C data consist in extracting information from these contact maps. One of the most striking patterns observed in intra-chromosomal Hi-C contact maps emerged from genomic regions that exhibit dense intra-region but sparse inter-region contacts. These have been termed topologically associating domains (TADs). The identification of TADs from Hi-C contact maps is of great interest as they have been shown to act as unit of chromosome organization and, potentially, functional activity. Several approaches have been developed to identify TADs (TAD callers). However, results from these methods are often dependent on data resolution and poorly concordant. In this chapter, we present four TAD callers and we provide detailed protocols for their use. In addition, we show how to compare TADs identified by different callers and how to assess the enrichment for TAD-associated biological features. TAD calling has become a key step in the study of chromatin 3D organization in different cellular contexts. Here we provide guidelines to improve the robustness and quality of these analyses.",

Across all datasets, gene co-regulation is observed only within a small yet significant number of chromatin domains. We design an algorithmic approach to identify differentially active domains (DADo) between two conditions and show that these provide complementary information to differentially expressed genes. Domains comprising co-regulated genes are enriched in the less active B sub-compartments and for genes with similar function. Notably, differential activation of chromatin domains is not associated with major changes of domain boundaries, but rather with changes of sub-compartments and intra-domain contacts.

Using a Bayesian inference framework, we validated computational predictions with high-throughput readouts from genetic and pharmacological screenings on 2,000 cancer cell lines. Mutually exclusive and co-occurring cancer alterations reflected, respectively, functional redundancies able to rescue the phenotype of individual target inhibition, or synergistic interactions, increasing oncogene addiction. Among the top scoring dependencies, co-alteration of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit PIK3CA and the nuclear factor NFE2L2 was a synergistic evolutionary trajectory in squamous cell carcinomas.

      "abstract": "Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a recurrent event in human cancers and it promotes chromosomal instability and acquisition of aneuploidies1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, the three-dimensional organization of chromatin in WGD cells and its contribution to oncogenic phenotypes are currently unknown. Here we show that in p53-deficient cells, WGD induces loss of chromatin segregation (LCS). This event is characterized by reduced segregation between short and long chromosomes, A and B subcompartments and adjacent chromatin domains. LCS is driven by the downregulation of CTCF and H3K9me3 in cells that bypassed activation of the tetraploid checkpoint. Longitudinal analyses revealed that LCS primes genomic regions for subcompartment repositioning in WGD cells. This results in chromatin and epigenetic changes associated with oncogene activation in tumours ensuing from WGD cells. Notably, subcompartment repositioning events were largely independent of chromosomal alterations, which indicates that these were complementary mechanisms contributing to tumour development and progression. Overall, LCS initiates chromatin conformation changes that ultimately result in oncogenic epigenetic and transcriptional modifications, which suggests that chromatin evolution is a hallmark of WGD-driven cancer.",

      "abstract": "Cancer evolution is driven by the concerted action of multiple molecular alterations, which emerge and are selected during tumor progression. An alteration is selected when it provides an advantage to the tumor cell. However, the advantage provided by a specific alteration depends on the tumor lineage, cell epigenetic state, and presence of additional alterations. In this case, we say that an evolutionary dependency exists between an alteration and what influences its selection. Epistatic interactions between altered genes lead to evolutionary dependencies (EDs), by favoring or vetoing specific combinations of events. Large-scale cancer genomics studies have discovered examples of such dependencies, and showed that they influence tumor progression, disease phenotypes, and therapeutic response. In the past decade, several algorithmic approaches have been proposed to infer EDs from large-scale genomics datasets. These methods adopt diverse strategies to address common challenges and shed new light on cancer evolutionary trajectories. Here, we review these efforts starting from a simple conceptualization of the problem, presenting the tackled and still unmet needs in the field, and discussing the implications of EDs in cancer biology and precision oncology.",

We found that extremely unstable tumors associated with DNA repair deficiencies or high chromosomal instability are not the most intrinsically heterogeneous. Conversely, intra-tumor heterogeneity is greatest in tumors exhibiting relatively high numbers of both mutations and copy number alterations, a feature often observed in cancers associated with exogenous mutagens. Independently of the type of instability, tumors with high number of clones invariably evolved through branching phylogenies that could be stratified based on the extent of clonal (early) and subclonal (late) instability. Interestingly, tumors with high number of subclonal mutations frequently exhibited chromosomal instability, TP53 mutations, and APOBEC-related mutational signatures. Vice versa, mutations of chromatin remodeling genes often characterized tumors with few subclonal but multiple clonal mutations.

Since structures are constrained by their biological function, their geometry tends to evolve more slowly than the underlying amino acids sequences. This feature of structures could in principle be used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees over longer evolutionary timescales than sequence-based approaches, but until now a reliable structure-based tree building method has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the use of structure-based phylogenies can outperform sequence-based ones not only for distantly related proteins but also, remarkably, for more closely related ones. This is achieved by inferring trees from protein structures using a local structural alphabet, an approach robust to conformational changes that confound traditional structural distance measures. As an illustration, we used structures to decipher the evolutionary diversification of a particularly challenging family: the fast-evolving RRNPPA quorum sensing receptors enabling gram-positive bacteria, plasmids and bacteriophages to communicate and coordinate key behaviors such as sporulation, virulence, antibiotic resistance, conjugation or phage lysis/lysogeny decision. The advent of high-accuracy structural phylogenetics enables myriad of applications across biology, such as uncovering deeper evolutionary relationships, elucidating unknown protein functions, or refining the design of bioengineered molecules.",

State-of-the-art tools to assess genome annotations measure the completeness of a gene repertoire but are blind to other errors, such as gene overprediction or contamination. We introduce OMArk, a software package that relies on fast, alignment-free sequence comparisons between a query proteome and precomputed gene families across the tree of life. OMArk assesses not only the completeness but also the consistency of the gene repertoire as a whole relative to closely related species and reports likely contamination events. Analysis of 1,805 UniProt Eukaryotic Reference Proteomes with OMArk demonstrated strong evidence of contamination in 73 proteomes and identified error propagation in avian gene annotation resulting from the use of a fragmented zebra finch proteome as a reference. This study illustrates the importance of comparing and prioritizing proteomes based on their quality measures.",

This membrane fusion reaction is driven by the formation of a tight complex comprising the plasma membrane N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins syntaxin-1a and SNAP-25 with the vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin. The neuronal protein Munc18-1 forms a stable complex with syntaxin-1a. Biochemically, syntaxin-1a cannot escape the tight grip of Munc18-1, so formation of the SNARE complex is inhibited. However, Munc18-1 is essential for the release of neurotransmitters in vivo. It has therefore been assumed that Munc18-1 makes the bound syntaxin-1a available for SNARE complex formation. Exactly how this occurs is still unclear, but it is assumed that structural rearrangements occur. Here, we used a series of mutations to specifically weaken the complex at different positions in order to induce these rearrangements biochemically. Our approach was guided through sequence and structural analysis and supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequently, we created a homology model showing the complex in an altered conformation. This conformation presumably represents a more open arrangement of syntaxin-1a that permits the formation of a SNARE complex to be initiated while still bound to Munc18-1. In the future, research should investigate how this central reaction for neuronal communication is controlled by other proteins.",

To do this, they assemble in a zipper-like fashion into stable complexes between the membranes. Structural studies have shown that the complexes consist of four different helices, which we subdivide into Qa-, Qb-, Qc-, and R-helix on the basis of their sequence signatures. Using a combination of biochemistry, modeling and molecular dynamics, we investigated how the four different types are arranged in a complex. We found that there is a matching pattern in the core of the complex that dictates the position of the four fundamental SNARE types in the bundle, resulting in a QabcR complex. In the cell, several different cognate QabcR-SNARE complexes catalyze the different transport steps between the compartments of the endomembrane system. Each of these cognate QabcR complexes is compiled from a repertoire of about 20 SNARE subtypes. Our studies show that exchange within the four types is largely tolerated structurally, although some non-cognate exchanges lead to structural imbalances. This suggests that SNARE complexes have evolved for a catalytic mechanism, a mechanism that leaves little scope for selectivity beyond the QabcR rule.",

Integrative analysis of these data outperforms conventional \u201cdropout\u201d screens in identifying cancer genes while prioritizing disease-relevant lncRNAs with pleiotropic and background-independent roles. Altogether, 80 high-confidence oncogenic lncRNAs are active in NSCLC, which tend to be amplified and overexpressed in tumors. A follow-up antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) screen shortlisted two candidates, Cancer Hallmarks in Lung LncRNA 1 (CHiLL1) and GCAWKR, whose knockdown consistently suppressed cancer hallmarks in two- and three-dimension tumor models. Molecular phenotyping reveals that CHiLL1 and GCAWKR control cellular-level phenotypes via distinct transcriptional networks.

The concept of MI profile shift is presented to quantify changes in MI upon mutation, revealing insights into residue-residue interactions. We apply this method to the case of Pyrin protein variants, which are associated with an autosomal recessively inherited disease called familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), since the available tools do not help predict the pathogenicity of the most penetrant variants. We demonstrate the utility of MI profile shifts in assessing the effects of mutations on protein stability, function, and disease phenotype. The importance of negative MI shifts as indicators of severe effects is emphasized, along with exploring potential compensatory mechanisms indicated by positive MI shifts, which are otherwise random and inconsequential. The paper also discusses challenges in relating MI profile changes to disease severity and advocates for comprehensive analysis considering genetic, environmental, and stochastic factors. Overall, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression and offers a framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets based on MI profile changes induced by mutations.",

We estimated that 16% of these associations are indirect, acting by increasing body mass index (BMI). Signals mapped to 45 unique, non-overlapping regions, nine of which being linked to known GDs. Number and identity of genes affected by CNVs modulated their pathogenicity, with many associations being supported by colocalization with both common and rare single-nucleotide variant association signals. Dissection of association signals provided insights into the epidemiology of known gene-disease pairs (e.g., deletions in BRCA1 and LDLR increased risk for ovarian cancer and ischemic heart disease, respectively), clarified dosage mechanisms of action (e.g., both increased and decreased dosage of 17q12 impacted renal health), and identified putative causal genes (e.g., ABCC6 for kidney stones). Characterization of the pleiotropic pathological consequences of recurrent CNVs at 15q13, 16p13.11, 16p12.2, and 22q11.2 in adulthood indicated variable expressivity of these regions and the involvement of multiple genes. Finally, we show that while the total burden of rare CNVs\u2014and especially deletions\u2014strongly associated with disease risk, it only accounted for ~ 0.02% of the UKBB disease burden. These associations are mainly driven by CNVs at known GD CNV regions, whose pleiotropic effect on common diseases was broader than anticipated by our CNV-GWAS.ConclusionsOur results shed light on the prominent role of rare CNVs in determining common disease susceptibility within the general population and provide actionable insights for anticipating later-onset comorbidities in carriers of recurrent CNVs.",

First, we cluster 324 BMI-associated genetic instruments based on their association with 407 traits in the UK Biobank, which yields six distinct groups. Subsequent cluster-specific MR reveals heterogeneous causal effect estimates on EDU. A cluster enriched for socio-economic indicators yields the largest BMI-on-EDU causal effect estimate ( = \u22120.49 [\u22120.56, \u22120.42]) whereas a cluster enriched for body-mass specific traits provides a more likely estimate ( = \u22120.09 [\u22120.13, \u22120.05]).

For later-life diseases, inference from case-control studies is hampered by the uncertainty that control group subjects might later be diagnosed. Time-to-event analysis treats controls as right-censored, making no additional assumptions about future disease occurrence and represents a more sound conceptual alternative for more accurate inference. Here, using data on 11 common cancers from the UK and Estonian Biobank studies, we provide empirical evidence that discovery and genomic prediction are greatly improved by analysing age-at-diagnosis, compared to a case-control model of association. We replicate previous findings from large-scale case-control studies and find an additional 7 previously unreported independent genomic regions, out of which 3 replicated in independent data. Our novel discoveries provide new insights into underlying cancer pathways, and our model yields a better understanding of the polygenicity and genetic architecture of the 11 tumours. We find that heritable germline genetic variation plays a vital role in cancer occurrence, with risk attributable to many thousands of underlying genomic regions. Finally, we show that Bayesian modelling strategies utilizing time-to-event data increase prediction accuracy by an average of 20% compared to a recent summary statistic approach (LDpred-funct). As sample sizes increase, incorporating time-to-event data should be commonplace, improving case-control studies by using richer information about the disease process.",

      "abstract": "Mendelian randomization (MR) can identify causal relationships from observational data but has increased Type 1 error rates (T1E) when genetic instruments are limited to a single associated region, a typical scenario for molecular exposures.  To address this, we developed MR-link-2, which uses summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to simultaneously estimate a causal effect and pleiotropy in a single associated region. We extensively compare MR-link-2 to other cis MR methods: i) In realistic simulations, MR-link-2 has calibrated T1E and high power. ii) We replicate causal relationships derived from three metabolic pathway references using four independent metabolite quantitative trait locus studies as input to MR. Compared to other methods, MR-link-2 has a superior area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) (up to 0.80). iii) Applied to canonical causal relationships between complex traits, MR-link-2 has a lower per-locus T1E rate than competing methods (0.09 vs 0.15, at a nominal 5% level) and has several fold less heterogeneous causal effect estimates. iv) Testing the correct causal direction between blood cell type compositions and gene expression of their marker genes reveals that MR-link has superior AUC 0.90 (best competing: 0.67). Finally, when testing for causality between metabolites that are not connected by canonical reactions, MR-link-2 exclusively identifies a link between glycine and pyrroline-5-carboxylate, corroborating results for hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-10, otherwise only found in model systems. Overall, MR-link-2 is the first method to identify pleiotropy-robust causality from summary statistics in single associated regions, making it ideally suited for applications on molecular phenotypes.",

Yet, studies focusing on parent-of-origin effects have been limited in terms of sample size due to the lack of parental genomes or known genealogies. We propose a probabilistic approach to infer the parent-of-origin of individual alleles that does not require parental genomes nor prior knowledge of genealogy. Our model uses Identity-By-Descent sharing with second- and third-degree relatives to assign alleles to parental groups and leverages chromosome X data in males to distinguish maternal from paternal groups. We combine this with robust haplotype inference and haploid imputation to infer the parent-of-origin for 26,393 UK Biobank individuals. We screen 99 phenotypes for parent-of-origin effects and replicate the discoveries of 6 GWAS studies, confirming signals on body mass index, type 2 diabetes, standing height and multiple blood biomarkers, including the known maternal effect at the MEG3/DLK1 locus on platelet phenotypes. We also report a novel maternal effect at the TERT gene on telomere length, thereby providing new insights on the heritability of this phenotype. All our summary statistics are publicly available to help the community to better characterize the molecular mechanisms leading to parent-of-origin effects and their implications for human health.",

Our findings at genome-wide significance level recover previously reported pharmacogenetic signals and also include novel associations for lipid response to statins (N = 26,669) near LDLR and ZNF800. Importantly, these associations are treatment-specific and not associated with biomarker progression in medication-naive individuals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that individuals with higher genetically determined low-density and total cholesterol baseline levels experience increased absolute, albeit lower relative biomarker reduction following statin treatment. In summary, we systematically investigated the common and rare pharmacogenetic contribution to cardiometabolic drug response phenotypes in over 50,000 UK Biobank and All of Us participants with EHR and identified clinically relevant genetic predictors for improved personalized treatment strategies.",

These constrains propagate to DNA sequence variants associated with traits under selection. The genetic imprints of such evolutionary events can thus be detected via combining effect size estimates from genetic association studies and the corresponding allele frequencies. While this approach has been successfully applied to high-level traits, the prevalence and mode of selection acting on molecular traits remains poorly understood. Here, we estimate the action of natural selection on genetic variants associated with metabolite levels, an important layer of molecular traits. By leveraging summary statistics of published genome-wide association studies with large sample sizes, we find strong evidence of stabilizing selection for 15 out of 97 plasma metabolites, with an overrepresentation of amino acids among such cases. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed that metabolites under stronger stabilizing selection display larger effects on key cardiometabolic traits, suggesting that maintaining a healthy cardiometabolic profile may be an important source of selective constraints on the metabolome. Metabolites under strong stabilizing selection in humans are also more conserved in their concentrations among diverse mammalian species, suggesting shared selective forces across micro and macroevolutionary time scales. Finally, we also found evidence for both disruptive and directional selection on specific lipid metabolites, potentially indicating ongoing evolutionary adaptation in humans. Overall, this study demonstrates that variation in metabolite levels among humans is frequently shaped by natural selection and this may be acting indirectly through maintaining cardiometabolic fitness.",

Yet, factors modulating telomere attrition and the health consequences thereof are not fully understood. To address this, we leveraged data from 326,363 unrelated UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Using linear regression and bidirectional univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR), we elucidate the relationships between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and 142 complex traits, including diseases, biomarkers, and lifestyle factors. We confirm that telomeres shorten with age and show a stronger decline in males than in females, with these factors contributing to the majority of the 5.4% of LTL variance explained by the phenome. MR reveals 23 traits modulating LTL. Smoking cessation and high educational attainment associate with longer LTL, while weekly alcohol intake, body mass index, urate levels, and female reproductive events, such as childbirth, associate with shorter LTL. We also identify 24 traits affected by LTL, with risk for cardiovascular, pulmonary, and some autoimmune diseases being increased by short LTL, while longer LTL increased risk for other autoimmune conditions and cancers. Through multivariable MR, we show that LTL may partially mediate the impact of educational attainment, body mass index, and female age at childbirth on proxied lifespan. Our study sheds light on the modulators, consequences, and the mediatory role of telomeres, portraying an intricate relationship between LTL, diseases, lifestyle, and socio-economic factors.",

Imputation pipelines commonly used for present-day genomes have been shown to yield accurate results when applied to ancient genomes. However, post-mortem damage (PMD), in the form of C-to-T substitutions at the reads termini, and contamination with DNA from closely related species can potentially affect imputation performance in aDNA. In this study, we evaluated imputation performance (i) when using a genotype caller designed for aDNA, ATLAS, compared to bcftools, and (ii) when contamination is present. We evaluated imputation performance with principal component analyses and by calculating imputation error rates. With a particular focus on differently imputed sites, we found that using ATLAS prior to imputation substantially improved imputed genotypes for a very damaged ancient genome (42% PMD). Trimming the ends of the sequencing reads led to similar improvements in imputation accuracy. For the remaining genomes, ATLAS brought limited gains. Finally, to examine the effect of contamination on imputation, we added various amounts of reads from two present-day genomes to a previously downsampled high-coverage ancient genome. We observed that imputation accuracy drastically decreased for contamination rates above 5%. In conclusion, we recommend (i) accounting for PMD by either trimming sequencing reads or using a genotype caller such as ATLAS before imputing highly damaged genomes and (ii) only imputing genomes containing up to 5% of contamination.",

Here we re-sequence an ancient trio (mother, father, son) and downsample and impute a total of 43 ancient genomes, including 42 high-coverage (above 10x) genomes. We assess imputation accuracy across ancestries, time, depth of coverage, and sequencing technology. We find that ancient and modern DNA imputation accuracies are comparable. When downsampled at 1x, 36 of the 42 genomes are imputed with low error rates (below 5%) while African genomes have higher error rates. We validate imputation and phasing results using the ancient trio data and an orthogonal approach based on Mendel\u2019s rules of inheritance. We further compare the downstream analysis results between imputed and high-coverage genomes, notably principal component analysis, genetic clustering, and runs of homozygosity, observing similar results starting from 0.5x coverage, except for the African genomes. These results suggest that, for most populations and depths of coverage as low as 0.5x, imputation is a reliable method that can improve ancient DNA studies.",

Here, we conduct a systematic comparison of alternative approaches against reference bias and against PMD. To reduce reference bias, we either (a) mask variable sites before alignment or (b) align the data to a graph genome representing all variable sites. Compared to alignment to the linear reference genome, both masking and graph alignment effectively remove allelic bias when using simulated or real ancient human genome data, but only if sequencing data is available in FASTQ or unfiltered BAM format. Reference bias remains indelible in quality-filtered BAM files and in 1240K-capture data. We next study three approaches to overcome postmortem damage: (a) trimming, (b) rescaling base qualities, and (c) a new algorithm we present here, bamRefine, which masks only PMD-vulnerable polymorphic sites. We find that bamRefine is optimal in increasing the number of genotyped loci up to 20% compared to trimming and in improving accuracy compared to rescaling. We propose graph alignment coupled with bamRefine to minimise data loss and bias. We also urge the paleogenomics community to publish FASTQ files.",

In this context, here we propose RESHAPE, a method that employs a recombination Poisson process on a reference panel to simulate the genomes of hypothetical descendants after multiple generations. This data transformation helps to protect against re-identification threats and preserves data attributes, such as linkage disequilibrium patterns and, to some degree, identity-by-descent sharing, allowing for genotype imputation.

Mutualistic systems constitute perfect study cases for analysing the effect of biotic interactions on species niches and communities\u2019 composition.  Methods We integrate mutualistic interactions into a niche quantification framework to analyse the effect of biotic interactions in the estimation of species niches, and competition patterns among clownfish communities.  Results Implementing biotic interactions in ecological niche modelling can improve the reliability of niche estimations, especially in specialist species. Additionally, resource partitioning decreases niche overlap among clownfishes allowing coexistence in species-rich habitats.  Main conclusions We provide a framework to estimate the effects of species interactions and demonstrate the importance of including biotic interaction to improve the estimation of species\u2019 ecological niches. Finally, we show how resource partitioning regulates competition and provides the ecological basis to explain why clownfishes have different sets of associations with sea anemones. The variety of mutualistic strategies serves to ecosystem sustainability, reducing the effect of saturation by species richness and competitive exclusion. Competition avoidance through resource partitioning may be the primary mechanism that shapes clownfish communities across the Indo-Pacific. These findings strongly support the importance of biotic interactions in shaping communities. Future studies could use the proposed analytical framework to serve multiple conservation purposes.",

Their use typically involves the development of a mechanistic framework reflecting our understanding of the underlying biological processes, such as nucleotide substitutions, and the estimation of model parameters by maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. However, deriving and optimizing the likelihood of the data is not always possible under complex evolutionary scenarios or tractable for large datasets, often leading to unrealistic simplifying assumptions in the fitted models. To overcome this issue, we couple stochastic simulations of genome evolution with a new supervised deep learning model to infer key parameters of molecular evolution. Our model is designed to directly analyze multiple sequence alignments and estimate per-site evolutionary rates and divergence, without requiring a known phylogenetic tree. The accuracy of our predictions matches that of likelihood-based phylogenetic inference, when rate heterogeneity follows a simple gamma distribution, but it strongly exceeds it under more complex patterns of rate variation, such as codon models. Our approach is highly scalable and can be efficiently applied to genomic data, as we show on a dataset of 26 million nucleotides from the clownfish clade. Our simulations also show that the per-site rates obtained by deep learning increase the likelihood of the true tree and could therefore lead to more accurate phylogenetic inference. We propose that future advancements in phylogenetic analysis will benefit from a semi-supervised learning approach that combines deep-learning estimation of substitution rates, which allows for more flexible models of rate variation, and probabilistic inference of the phylogenetic tree, which guarantees interpretability and a rigorous assessments of statistical support.",

      "abstract": "Clownfishes are an iconic group of coral reef fishes that evolved a mutualistic interaction with sea anemones, which triggered the rapid diversification of the group. Following the emergence of this mutualism, clownfishes diversified into different ecological niches and developed convergent phenotypes associated with their host use. The genetic basis of the initial acquisition of the mutualism with host anemones has been described, but the genomic architecture underlying clownfish diversification once the mutualism was established and the extent to which clownfish phenotypic convergence originated through shared genetic mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we investigated these questions by performing comparative genomic analyses on the available genomic data of five pairs of closely related but ecologically divergent clownfish species. We found that clownfish diversification was characterized by bursts of transposable elements, an overall accelerated coding evolution, incomplete lineage sorting, and ancestral hybridization events. Additionally, we detected a signature of positive selection in 5.4% of the clownfish genes. Among them, five presented functions associated with social behavior and ecology, and they represent candidate genes involved in the evolution of the size-based hierarchical social structure so particular to clownfishes. Finally, we found genes with patterns of either relaxation or intensification of purifying selection and signals of positive selection linked with clownfish ecological divergence, suggesting some level of parallel evolution during the diversification of the group. Altogether, this work provides the first insights into the genomic substrate of clownfish adaptive radiation and integrates the growing collection of studies investigating the genomic mechanisms governing species diversification.",

      "abstract": "Clownfish (subfamily Amphiprioninae) are an iconic group of coral reef fish that evolved a mutualistic interaction with sea anemones, which triggered the adaptive radiation of the clade. Within clownfishes, the \"skunk complex\" is particularly interesting. Besides ecological speciation, interspecific gene flow and hybrid speciation are thought to have shaped the evolution of the group. We investigated the mechanisms characterizing the diversification of this complex. By taking advantage of their disjunct geographical distribution, we obtained whole-genome data of sympatric and allopatric populations of the three main species of the complex (Amphiprion akallopisos, A. perideraion and A. sandaracinos). We examined population structure, genomic divergence and introgression signals and performed demographic modelling to identify the most realistic diversification scenario. We excluded scenarios of strict isolation or hybrid origin of A. sandaracinos. We discovered moderate gene flow from A. perideraion to the ancestor of A. akallopisos+ A. sandaracinos and weak gene flow between the species in the Indo-Australian Archipelago throughout the diversification of the group. We identified introgressed regions in A. sandaracinos and detected in A. perideraion two large regions of high divergence from the two other species. While we found that gene flow has occurred throughout the species' diversification, we also observed that recent admixture was less pervasive than initially thought, suggesting a role of host repartition or behavioural barriers in maintaining the genetic identity of the species in sympatry.",

Indeed, different soft barriers structure the marine environment, which offers an appealing opportunity to study various evolutionary processes such as population differentiation and speciation. Here, we focus on Amphiprion clarkii (Actinopterygii; Perciformes), the most widespread of clownfishes that exhibits the highest colour polymorphism. Clownfishes can only disperse during a short pelagic larval phase before their sessile adult lifestyle, which might limit connectivity among populations, thus facilitating speciation events. Consequently, the taxonomic status of A. clarkii has been under debate. We used whole-genome resequencing data of 67 A. clarkii specimens spread across the Indian and Pacific Oceans to characterise the species\u2019 population structure, demographic history, and colour polymorphism. We found that A. clarkii spread from the Indo-Pacific Ocean to the Pacific and Indian Oceans following a stepping-stone dispersal and that gene flow was pervasive throughout its demographic history. Moreover, edge populations exhibited more similar colouration patterns compared to central populations. However, we demonstrate that colour polymorphism is not associated with population structure, thus, colour phenotype is unreliable in assessing the taxonomic status of A. clarkii. Our study further highlights the power of whole-genome comparative studies to determine the taxonomy of geographically wide-ranging and phenotypically diverse species, supporting the status of A. clarkii as a single species.",

Not only can we learn from hybrid zones about the mechanisms of speciation and how reproductive isolation is maintained, but we can also study their impact on evolutionary processes. Thanks to the advent of next-generation sequencing, we are now able to gain new insight into the structure of hybrid genomes and the factors influencing the outcome of hybridisation. Here, we focus on the Kimbe Bay hybrid zone, a narrow region in the Pacific Ocean where two species of clownfish - Amphiprion chrysopterus and A. sandaracinos - hybridise and give rise to the hybrid A. leucokranos. Based on whole-genome sequencing, we found that the hybrid zone is mainly composed of first-generation hybrids, the first evidence of F2 hybrids in the wild and early backcrosses with A. sandaracinos. The recurrent backcrossing with one of the parental species might lead to adaptive introgression, with few adaptive introgressed loci from A. chrysopterus integrated into the A. sandaracinos genomic background. This study builds upon the growing literature body relative to the evolutionary outcomes of hybridisation and its importance in the evolution of many species.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The clownfish - sea anemone mutualism was suggested to have triggered the adaptive radiation of clownfishes, but the origin of clownfish resistance to stinging tentacles of host anemones remains unclear. The presence of specific compounds in the mucus of clownfishes conferring them the unique ability to prevent nematocyst discharge from their hosts has been the most supported hypothesis. Yet the mystery regarding the types of compounds found in clownfish skin mucus remains unsolved.  Methods: We analyzed the chemical composition of clownfish and damselfish mucus using an untargeted metabolomics (HILIC-HRMS) and lipidomics (RPLC-HRMS) approach.  Results and Discussion: The polar and lipid metabolome signatures were highly specific and allowed to discriminate between the clownfish and damselfish clades. The most discriminative part of the signature was the sphingolipid profile, displaying a broader diversity of ceramides present in significantly higher levels in clownfish mucus. Importantly, the inter-specific variability of metabolic signature was significantly higher in clownfishes, although their diversification is evolutionarily more recent, thus implying the impact of symbiosis on metabolic variability and adaptation. Furthermore, specialists and generalists clownfish species displayed distinctive metabolite signature. Two strict clownfish specialists, which are phylogenetically distant but share the same host species, clustered together based on their molecular signature, suggesting a link with their mutualistic nature. Overall, comparative analyses of metabolic signatures highlight differences in chemical composition of clownfish mucus and provide insight into biochemical pathways potentially implicated in clownfish adaptation to inhabit sea anemones and consequently diversify.",

      "abstract": "Popular comparative phylogenetic models such as Brownian Motion, Ornstein-Ulhenbeck, and their extensions, assume that, at speciation, a trait value is inherited identically by the two descendant species. This assumption contrasts with models of speciation at the micro-evolutionary scale where phenotypic distributions of the descendants are sub-samples of the ancestral distribution. Various described mechanisms of speciation can lead to a displacement of the ancestral phenotypic mean among descendants and an asymmetric inheritance of the ancestral phenotypic variance. In contrast, even macro-evolutionary models that account for intraspecific variance assume symmetrically conserved inheritance of the ancestral phenotypic distribution at speciation. Here we develop an Asymmetric Brownian Motion model (ABM) that relaxes the hypothesis of symmetric and conserved inheritance of the ancestral distribution at the time of speciation. The ABM jointly models the evolution of both intra- and inter-specific phenotypic variation. It also allows the mode of phenotypic inheritance at speciation to be inferred, ranging from a symmetric and conserved inheritance, where descendants inherit the ancestral distribution, to an asymmetric and displaced inheritance, where descendants inherit divergent phenotypic means and variances. To demonstrate this model, we analyze the evolution of beak morphology in Darwin finches, finding evidence of character displacement at speciation. The ABM model helps to bridge micro- and macro-evolutionary models of trait evolution by providing a more robust framework for testing the effects of ecological speciation, character displacement, and niche partitioning on trait evolution at the macro-evolutionary scale.",

However, methods using within-species variation do not integrate the changes at the macro-evolutionary scale. Conversely, current methods using between-species variation usually discard within-species variation, thus not accounting for processes at the micro-evolutionary scale. The main goal of this study is to define a neutrality index for a quantitative trait, by combining within- and between-species variation. This neutrality index integrates nucleotide polymorphism and divergence for normalizing trait variation. As such, it does not require estimation of population size nor of time of speciation for normalization. Our index can be used to seek deviation from the null model of neutral evolution, and test for diversifying selection. Applied to brain mass and body mass at the mammalian scale, we show that brain mass is under diversifying selection. Finally, we show that our test is not sensitive to the assumption that population sizes, mutation rates and generation time are constant across the phylogeny, and automatically adjust for it.",
