      "abstract": "Clownfish (subfamily Amphiprioninae) are an iconic group of coral reef fish that evolved a mutualistic interaction with sea anemones, which triggered the adaptive radiation of the clade. Within clownfishes, the \"skunk complex\" is particularly interesting. Besides ecological speciation, interspecific gene flow and hybrid speciation are thought to have shaped the evolution of the group. We investigated the mechanisms characterizing the diversification of this complex. By taking advantage of their disjunct geographical distribution, we obtained whole-genome data of sympatric and allopatric populations of the three main species of the complex (Amphiprion akallopisos, A. perideraion and A. sandaracinos). We examined population structure, genomic divergence and introgression signals and performed demographic modelling to identify the most realistic diversification scenario. We excluded scenarios of strict isolation or hybrid origin of A. sandaracinos. We discovered moderate gene flow from A. perideraion to the ancestor of A. akallopisos+ A. sandaracinos and weak gene flow between the species in the Indo-Australian Archipelago throughout the diversification of the group. We identified introgressed regions in A. sandaracinos and detected in A. perideraion two large regions of high divergence from the two other species. While we found that gene flow has occurred throughout the species' diversification, we also observed that recent admixture was less pervasive than initially thought, suggesting a role of host repartition or behavioural barriers in maintaining the genetic identity of the species in sympatry.",

Not only can we learn from hybrid zones about the mechanisms of speciation and how reproductive isolation is maintained, but we can also study their impact on evolutionary processes. Thanks to the advent of next-generation sequencing, we are now able to gain new insight into the structure of hybrid genomes and the factors influencing the outcome of hybridisation. Here, we focus on the Kimbe Bay hybrid zone, a narrow region in the Pacific Ocean where two species of clownfish - Amphiprion chrysopterus and A. sandaracinos - hybridise and give rise to the hybrid A. leucokranos. Based on whole-genome sequencing, we found that the hybrid zone is mainly composed of first-generation hybrids, the first evidence of F2 hybrids in the wild and early backcrosses with A. sandaracinos. The recurrent backcrossing with one of the parental species might lead to adaptive introgression, with few adaptive introgressed loci from A. chrysopterus integrated into the A. sandaracinos genomic background. This study builds upon the growing literature body relative to the evolutionary outcomes of hybridisation and its importance in the evolution of many species.",

      "abstract": "Clownfishes are an iconic group of coral reef fishes that evolved a mutualistic interaction with sea anemones, which triggered the rapid diversification of the group. Following the emergence of this mutualism, clownfishes diversified into different ecological niches and developed convergent phenotypes associated with their host use. The genetic basis of the initial acquisition of the mutualism with host anemones has been described, but the genomic architecture underlying clownfish diversification once the mutualism was established and the extent to which clownfish phenotypic convergence originated through shared genetic mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we investigated these questions by performing comparative genomic analyses on the available genomic data of five pairs of closely related but ecologically divergent clownfish species. We found that clownfish diversification was characterized by bursts of transposable elements, an overall accelerated coding evolution, incomplete lineage sorting, and ancestral hybridization events. Additionally, we detected a signature of positive selection in 5.4% of the clownfish genes. Among them, five presented functions associated with social behavior and ecology, and they represent candidate genes involved in the evolution of the size-based hierarchical social structure so particular to clownfishes. Finally, we found genes with patterns of either relaxation or intensification of purifying selection and signals of positive selection linked with clownfish ecological divergence, suggesting some level of parallel evolution during the diversification of the group. Altogether, this work provides the first insights into the genomic substrate of clownfish adaptive radiation and integrates the growing collection of studies investigating the genomic mechanisms governing species diversification.",

      "abstract": "Popular comparative phylogenetic models such as Brownian Motion, Ornstein-Ulhenbeck, and their extensions, assume that, at speciation, a trait value is inherited identically by the two descendant species. This assumption contrasts with models of speciation at the micro-evolutionary scale where phenotypic distributions of the descendants are sub-samples of the ancestral distribution. Various described mechanisms of speciation can lead to a displacement of the ancestral phenotypic mean among descendants and an asymmetric inheritance of the ancestral phenotypic variance. In contrast, even macro-evolutionary models that account for intraspecific variance assume symmetrically conserved inheritance of the ancestral phenotypic distribution at speciation. Here we develop an Asymmetric Brownian Motion model (ABM) that relaxes the hypothesis of symmetric and conserved inheritance of the ancestral distribution at the time of speciation. The ABM jointly models the evolution of both intra- and inter-specific phenotypic variation. It also allows the mode of phenotypic inheritance at speciation to be inferred, ranging from a symmetric and conserved inheritance, where descendants inherit the ancestral distribution, to an asymmetric and displaced inheritance, where descendants inherit divergent phenotypic means and variances. To demonstrate this model, we analyze the evolution of beak morphology in Darwin finches, finding evidence of character displacement at speciation. The ABM model helps to bridge micro- and macro-evolutionary models of trait evolution by providing a more robust framework for testing the effects of ecological speciation, character displacement, and niche partitioning on trait evolution at the macro-evolutionary scale.",

Mutualistic systems constitute perfect study cases for analysing the effect of biotic interactions on species niches and communities\u2019 composition.\n\nMethods We integrate mutualistic interactions into a niche quantification framework to analyse the effect of biotic interactions in the estimation of species niches, and competition patterns among clownfish communities.\n\nResults Implementing biotic interactions in ecological niche modelling can improve the reliability of niche estimations, especially in specialist species. Additionally, resource partitioning decreases niche overlap among clownfishes allowing coexistence in species-rich habitats.\n\nMain conclusions We provide a framework to estimate the effects of species interactions and demonstrate the importance of including biotic interaction to improve the estimation of species\u2019 ecological niches. Finally, we show how resource partitioning regulates competition and provides the ecological basis to explain why clownfishes have different sets of associations with sea anemones. The variety of mutualistic strategies serves to ecosystem sustainability, reducing the effect of saturation by species richness and competitive exclusion. Competition avoidance through resource partitioning may be the primary mechanism that shapes clownfish communities across the Indo-Pacific. These findings strongly support the importance of biotic interactions in shaping communities. Future studies could use the proposed analytical framework to serve multiple conservation purposes.",

The presence of specific compounds in the mucus of clownfishes conferring them the unique ability to prevent nematocyst discharge from their hosts has been the most supported hypothesis. Yet the mystery regarding the types of compounds found in clownfish skin mucus remains unsolved.\n\nMethods: We analyzed the chemical composition of clownfish and damselfish mucus using an untargeted metabolomics (HILIC-HRMS) and lipidomics (RPLC-HRMS) approach.\n\nResults and Discussion: The polar and lipid metabolome signatures were highly specific and allowed to discriminate between the clownfish and damselfish clades. The most discriminative part of the signature was the sphingolipid profile, displaying a broader diversity of ceramides present in significantly higher levels in clownfish mucus. Importantly, the inter-specific variability of metabolic signature was significantly higher in clownfishes, although their diversification is evolutionarily more recent, thus implying the impact of symbiosis on metabolic variability and adaptation. Furthermore, specialists and generalists clownfish species displayed distinctive metabolite signature. Two strict clownfish specialists, which are phylogenetically distant but share the same host species, clustered together based on their molecular signature, suggesting a link with their mutualistic nature. Overall, comparative analyses of metabolic signatures highlight differences in chemical composition of clownfish mucus and provide insight into biochemical pathways potentially implicated in clownfish adaptation to inhabit sea anemones and consequently diversify.",

Indeed, different soft barriers structure the marine environment, which offers an appealing opportunity to study various evolutionary processes such as population differentiation and speciation. Here, we focus on Amphiprion clarkii (Actinopterygii; Perciformes), the most widespread of clownfishes that exhibits the highest colour polymorphism. Clownfishes can only disperse during a short pelagic larval phase before their sessile adult lifestyle, which might limit connectivity among populations, thus facilitating speciation events. Consequently, the taxonomic status of A. clarkii has been under debate. We used whole-genome resequencing data of 67 A. clarkii specimens spread across the Indian and Pacific Oceans to characterise the species\u2019 population structure, demographic history, and colour polymorphism. We found that A. clarkii spread from the Indo-Pacific Ocean to the Pacific and Indian Oceans following a stepping-stone dispersal and that gene flow was pervasive throughout its demographic history. Moreover, edge populations exhibited more similar colouration patterns compared to central populations. However, we demonstrate that colour polymorphism is not associated with population structure, thus, colour phenotype is unreliable in assessing the taxonomic status of A. clarkii. Our study further highlights the power of whole-genome comparative studies to determine the taxonomy of geographically wide-ranging and phenotypically diverse species, supporting the status of A. clarkii as a single species.",

Conversely, current methods using between-species variation usually discard within-species variation, thus not accounting for processes at the micro-evolutionary scale. The main goal of this study is to define a neutrality index for a quantitative trait, by combining within- and between-species variation. This neutrality index integrates nucleotide polymorphism and divergence for normalizing trait variation. As such, it does not require estimation of population size nor of time of speciation for normalization. Our index can be used to seek deviation from the null model of neutral evolution, and test for diversifying selection. Applied to brain mass and body mass at the mammalian scale, we show that brain mass is under diversifying selection. Finally, we show that our test is not sensitive to the assumption that population sizes, mutation rates and generation time are constant across the phylogeny, and automatically adjust for it.",

      "abstract": "Models have always been central to inferring molecular evolution and to reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Their use typically involves the development of a mechanistic framework reflecting our understanding of the underlying biological processes, such as nucleotide substitutions, and the estimation of model parameters by maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. However, deriving and optimizing the likelihood of the data is not always possible under complex evolutionary scenarios or tractable for large datasets, often leading to unrealistic simplifying assumptions in the fitted models. To overcome this issue, we couple stochastic simulations of genome evolution with a new supervised deep learning model to infer key parameters of molecular evolution. Our model is designed to directly analyze multiple sequence alignments and estimate per-site evolutionary rates and divergence, without requiring a known phylogenetic tree. The accuracy of our predictions matches that of likelihood-based phylogenetic inference, when rate heterogeneity follows a simple gamma distribution, but it strongly exceeds it under more complex patterns of rate variation, such as codon models. Our approach is highly scalable and can be efficiently applied to genomic data, as we show on a dataset of 26 million nucleotides from the clownfish clade. Our simulations also show that the per-site rates obtained by deep learning increase the likelihood of the true tree and could therefore lead to more accurate phylogenetic inference. We propose that future advancements in phylogenetic analysis will benefit from a semi-supervised learning approach that combines deep-learning estimation of substitution rates, which allows for more flexible models of rate variation, and probabilistic inference of the phylogenetic tree, which guarantees interpretability and a rigorous assessments of statistical support.",

Applying a mutation-selection model, we estimated amino acid fitness landscapes for mammalian protein-coding genes.

We performed Genome-Wide Association Studies of these phenotypes. From this, we estimated their heritabilities, ranging between 5 and 25%, and genetic cross-phenotype correlations, which mostly mirrored the corresponding phenotypic correlations, but tended to be slightly larger. Projecting our genetic association signals onto genes and pathways revealed remarkably low overlap suggesting largely decoupled mechanisms modulating the different phenotypes. Our disease phenotype associations confirmed some previously known findings and revealed many novel connections. Notably, diameter variability, especially for the veins, seems to have new and interesting associations with diseases, including heart attack, pulmonary embolism, and age of death. Mendelian Randomization analysis suggests a causal influence of blood pressure and body mass index on retinal vessel morphology, among other results. We validated key findings in two independent smaller cohorts.

We then performed the largest GWAS of these traits to date and assessed gene set enrichment using the novel high-precision statistical method PascalX.\nMain Outcome Measure: We evaluated the genetic association of retinal tortuosity, measured by the dis- tance factor.\nResults: Higher retinal tortuosity was significantly associated with higher incidence of angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and hypertension. We identified 175 significantly associated genetic loci in the UK Biobank; 173 of these were novel and 4 replicated in our second, much smaller, metacohort. We estimated heritability at w25% using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Vessel type specific GWAS revealed 116 loci for arteries and 63 for veins. Genes with significant association signals included COL4A2, ACTN4, LGALS4, LGALS7, LGALS7B, TNS1, MAP4K1, EIF3K, CAPN12, ECH1, and SYNPO2. These tortuosity genes were overexpressed in arteries and heart muscle and linked to pathways related to the structural properties of the vasculature. We demon- strated that retinal tortuosity loci served pleiotropic functions as cardiometabolic disease variants and risk factors. Concordantly, MR revealed causal effects between tortuosity, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein.\nConclusions: Several alleles associated with retinal vessel tortuosity suggest a common genetic architecture of this trait with ocular diseases (glaucoma, myopia), cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. Our results shed new light on the genetics of vascular diseases and their pathomechanisms and highlight how GWASs and heritability can be used to improve phenotype extraction from high-dimensional data, such as images.",

Methods already exist to account for this when aggregating effects from a single GWAS across genes or pathways. Here we present a rigorous yet fast method for detecting genes with coherent association signals for two traits, facilitating cross-GWAS analyses. To this end, we devised a new significance test for the covariance of datapoints not drawn independently but with a known inter-sample covariance structure. We show that the distribution of its test statistic is a linear combination of \u03c72 distributions with positive and negative coefficients. The corresponding cumulative distribution function can be efficiently calculated with Davies\u2019 algorithm at high precision. We apply this general framework to test for dependence between SNP-wise effect sizes of two GWAS at the gene level. We extend this test to detect also gene-wise causal links.

Our method detects a potential role played by chemokine receptor genes linked to TH1 versus TH2 immune response, a gene related to integrin beta-1 cell surface expression, and other genes potentially impacting the severity of COVID-19.

Using a combination of biochemistry, modeling and molecular dynamics, we investigated how the four different types are arranged in a complex. We found that there is a matching pattern in the core of the complex that dictates the position of the four fundamental SNARE types in the bundle, resulting in a QabcR complex. In the cell, several different cognate QabcR-SNARE complexes catalyze the different transport steps between the compartments of the endomembrane system. Each of these cognate QabcR complexes is compiled from a repertoire of about 20 SNARE subtypes. Our studies show that exchange within the four types is largely tolerated structurally, although some non-cognate exchanges lead to structural imbalances. This suggests that SNARE complexes have evolved for a catalytic mechanism, a mechanism that leaves little scope for selectivity beyond the QabcR rule.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a novel method to assess the pathogenicity of mutations by affecting a phenotype and/or its severity, with a specific emphasis on the role of mutual information (MI) as a measure to quantify the correlation between residue motions or fluctuations. The concept of MI profile shift is presented to quantify changes in MI upon mutation, revealing insights into residue-residue interactions. We apply this method to the case of Pyrin protein variants, which are associated with an autosomal recessively inherited disease called familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), since the available tools do not help predict the pathogenicity of the most penetrant variants. We demonstrate the utility of MI profile shifts in assessing the effects of mutations on protein stability, function, and disease phenotype. The importance of negative MI shifts as indicators of severe effects is emphasized, along with exploring potential compensatory mechanisms indicated by positive MI shifts, which are otherwise random and inconsequential. The paper also discusses challenges in relating MI profile changes to disease severity and advocates for comprehensive analysis considering genetic, environmental, and stochastic factors. Overall, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression and offers a framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets based on MI profile changes induced by mutations.",

      "abstract": "Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles, the membrane of which fuses with the plasma membrane upon calcium influx. This membrane fusion reaction is driven by the formation of a tight complex comprising the plasma membrane N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins syntaxin-1a and SNAP-25 with the vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin. The neuronal protein Munc18-1 forms a stable complex with syntaxin-1a. Biochemically, syntaxin-1a cannot escape the tight grip of Munc18-1, so formation of the SNARE complex is inhibited. However, Munc18-1 is essential for the release of neurotransmitters in vivo. It has therefore been assumed that Munc18-1 makes the bound syntaxin-1a available for SNARE complex formation. Exactly how this occurs is still unclear, but it is assumed that structural rearrangements occur. Here, we used a series of mutations to specifically weaken the complex at different positions in order to induce these rearrangements biochemically. Our approach was guided through sequence and structural analysis and supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequently, we created a homology model showing the complex in an altered conformation. This conformation presumably represents a more open arrangement of syntaxin-1a that permits the formation of a SNARE complex to be initiated while still bound to Munc18-1. In the future, research should investigate how this central reaction for neuronal communication is controlled by other proteins.",

However, the three-dimensional organization of chromatin in WGD cells and its contribution to oncogenic phenotypes are currently unknown. Here we show that in p53-deficient cells, WGD induces loss of chromatin segregation (LCS). This event is characterized by reduced segregation between short and long chromosomes, A and B subcompartments and adjacent chromatin domains. LCS is driven by the downregulation of CTCF and H3K9me3 in cells that bypassed activation of the tetraploid checkpoint. Longitudinal analyses revealed that LCS primes genomic regions for subcompartment repositioning in WGD cells. This results in chromatin and epigenetic changes associated with oncogene activation in tumours ensuing from WGD cells. Notably, subcompartment repositioning events were largely independent of chromosomal alterations, which indicates that these were complementary mechanisms contributing to tumour development and progression. Overall, LCS initiates chromatin conformation changes that ultimately result in oncogenic epigenetic and transcriptional modifications, which suggests that chromatin evolution is a hallmark of WGD-driven cancer.",

      "abstract": "Cancer evolution is driven by the concerted action of multiple molecular alterations, which emerge and are selected during tumor progression. An alteration is selected when it provides an advantage to the tumor cell. However, the advantage provided by a specific alteration depends on the tumor lineage, cell epigenetic state, and presence of additional alterations. In this case, we say that an evolutionary dependency exists between an alteration and what influences its selection. Epistatic interactions between altered genes lead to evolutionary dependencies (EDs), by favoring or vetoing specific combinations of events. Large-scale cancer genomics studies have discovered examples of such dependencies, and showed that they influence tumor progression, disease phenotypes, and therapeutic response. In the past decade, several algorithmic approaches have been proposed to infer EDs from large-scale genomics datasets. These methods adopt diverse strategies to address common challenges and shed new light on cancer evolutionary trajectories. Here, we review these efforts starting from a simple conceptualization of the problem, presenting the tackled and still unmet needs in the field, and discussing the implications of EDs in cancer biology and precision oncology.",

      "abstract": "Chromatin folding in the 3D space of the nucleus can be explored through high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) approaches. These experiments quantify the number of interactions between any pair of genomic loci in the genome and, thus, allow building genome-scale maps of intra- and inter-chromosomal contacts (contact maps). Statistical and algorithmic analyses of Hi-C data consist in extracting information from these contact maps. One of the most striking patterns observed in intra-chromosomal Hi-C contact maps emerged from genomic regions that exhibit dense intra-region but sparse inter-region contacts. These have been termed topologically associating domains (TADs). The identification of TADs from Hi-C contact maps is of great interest as they have been shown to act as unit of chromosome organization and, potentially, functional activity. Several approaches have been developed to identify TADs (TAD callers). However, results from these methods are often dependent on data resolution and poorly concordant. In this chapter, we present four TAD callers and we provide detailed protocols for their use. In addition, we show how to compare TADs identified by different callers and how to assess the enrichment for TAD-associated biological features. TAD calling has become a key step in the study of chromatin 3D organization in different cellular contexts. Here we provide guidelines to improve the robustness and quality of these analyses.",

We found that extremely unstable tumors associated with DNA repair deficiencies or high chromosomal instability are not the most intrinsically heterogeneous. Conversely, intra-tumor heterogeneity is greatest in tumors exhibiting relatively high numbers of both mutations and copy number alterations, a feature often observed in cancers associated with exogenous mutagens. Independently of the type of instability, tumors with high number of clones invariably evolved through branching phylogenies that could be stratified based on the extent of clonal (early) and subclonal (late) instability. Interestingly, tumors with high number of subclonal mutations frequently exhibited chromosomal instability, TP53 mutations, and APOBEC-related mutational signatures. Vice versa, mutations of chromatin remodeling genes often characterized tumors with few subclonal but multiple clonal mutations.
