K_telomeres_health,"Breaking down causes, consequences, and mediating effects of telomere length variation on human health","Samuel Moix, Marie C Sadler, Zoltán Kutalik, Chiara Auwerx","Telomeres, human health","Telomeres form repeated DNAsequences at the ends of chromosomes, which shorten with each cell division. Yet, factors modulating telomere attrition and the health consequences thereof are not fully understood. To address this, we leveraged data from 326,363 unrelated UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. Using linear regression and bidirectional univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR), we elucidate the relationships between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and 142 complex traits, including diseases, biomarkers, and lifestyle factors. We confirm that telomeres shorten with age and show a stronger decline in males than in females, with these factors contributing to the majority of the 5.4% of LTL variance explained by the phenome. MR reveals 23 traits modulating LTL. Smoking cessation and high educational attainment associate with longer LTL, while weekly alcohol intake, body mass index, urate levels, and female reproductive events, such as childbirth, associate with shorter LTL. We also identify 24 traits affected by LTL, with risk for cardiovascular, pulmonary, and some autoimmune diseases being increased by short LTL, while longer LTL increased risk for other autoimmune conditions and cancers. Through multivariable MR, we show that LTL may partially mediate the impact of educational attainment, body mass index, and female age at childbirth on proxied lifespan. Our study sheds light on the modulators, consequences, and the mediatory role of telomeres, portraying an intricate relationship between LTL, diseases, lifestyle, and socio-economic factors.",https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-024-03269-9,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EQyX9bUz8FdPgYaBvrEDY34BXYUjjQl3u4yIr7wMILH2-A?e=cF4mkX

mechanism-specific causal effects between obesity and educational 
attainment","Liza Darrous, Gibran Hemani, George Davey Smith, Zoltán Kutalik","PheWAS, Mendelian randomization, obesity, educational attainment","Mendelian Randomisation (MR) estimates causal effects between 
risk factors and complex outcomes using genetic instruments. Pleiotropy, heritable confounders, and heterogeneous causal effects violate MR assumptions and can lead to biases. To alleviate these, we propose an approach employing a Phenome-Wide association Clustering of the MR instruments (PWC-MR) and apply this method to revisit the surprisingly large apparent causal effect of body mass index (BMI) on educational attainment (EDU):  = −0.19 [−0.22, −0.16]. First, we cluster 324 BMI-associated genetic instruments based on their association with 407 traits in the UK Biobank, which yields six distinct groups. Subsequent cluster-specific MR reveals heterogeneous causal effect estimates on EDU. A cluster enriched for socio-economic indicators yields the largest BMI-on-EDU causal effect estimate ( = −0.49 [−0.56, −0.42]) whereas a cluster enriched for body-mass specific traits provides a more likely estimate ( = −0.09 [−0.13, −0.05]). Follow-up analyses confirms these findings: within-sibling MR ( = −0.05 [−0.09, −0.01]); MR for childhood BMI on EDU ( = −0.03 [−0.06, −0.002]); step-wise multivariable MR ( = −0.05 [−0.07, −0.02]) where socio-economic indicators are jointly modelled. Here we show how the in-depth examination of the BMI-EDU causal relationship demonstrates the utility of our PWC-MR approach in revealing distinct pleiotropic pathways and confounder mechanisms.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-45655-8,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/ESX5pYzuBMtLhJ4aBKL7SycBgwuIsRSFrLdMp47kfMzpAw?e=fwa6Ra

We estimated that 16% of these associations are indirect, acting by increasing body mass index (BMI). Signals mapped to 45 unique, non-overlapping regions, nine of which being linked to known GDs. Number and identity of genes affected by CNVs modulated their pathogenicity, with many associations being supported by colocalization with both common and rare single-nucleotide variant association signals. Dissection of association signals provided insights into the epidemiology of known gene-disease pairs (e.g., deletions in BRCA1 and LDLR increased risk for ovarian cancer and ischemic heart disease, respectively), clarified dosage mechanisms of action (e.g., both increased and decreased dosage of 17q12 impacted renal health), and identified putative causal genes (e.g., ABCC6 for kidney stones). Characterization of the pleiotropic pathological consequences of recurrent CNVs at 15q13, 16p13.11, 16p12.2, and 22q11.2 in adulthood indicated variable expressivity of these regions and the involvement of multiple genes. Finally, we show that while the total burden of rare CNVs—and especially deletions—strongly associated with disease risk, it only accounted for ~ 0.02% of the UKBB disease burden. These associations are mainly driven by CNVs at known GD CNV regions, whose pleiotropic effect on common diseases was broader than anticipated by our CNV-GWAS.ConclusionsOur results shed light on the prominent role of rare CNVs in determining common disease susceptibility within the general population and provide actionable insights for anticipating later-onset comorbidities in carriers of recurrent CNVs.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13073-023-01265-5,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EUtqUPWXT3tLgAC9yKnSx28B1uqXOwWFhSTg6RfA89DiUQ?e=9fLTpY
K_pharmacogenetics,Leveraging large-scale biobank EHRs to enhance pharmacogenetics of cardiometabolic disease medications,"Marie C Sadler, Alexander Apostolov, Caterina Cevallos, Diogo M Ribeiro, Russ B Altman, Zoltán Kutalik","Electronic health records, statins, pharmacogenetics, drug response","Electronic health records (EHRs) coupled with large-scale biobanks offer 
great promises to unravel the genetic underpinnings of treatment efficacy. However, medication-induced biomarker trajectories stemming from such records remain poorly studied. Here, we extract clinical and medication prescription data from EHRs and conduct GWAS and rare variant burden tests in the UK Biobank (discovery) and the All of Us program (replication) on ten cardiometabolic drug response outcomes including lipid response to statins, HbA1c response to metformin and blood pressure response to antihypertensives (N = 740-26,669). Our findings at genome-wide significance level recover previously reported pharmacogenetic signals and also include novel associations for lipid response to statins (N = 26,669) near LDLR and ZNF800. Importantly, these associations are treatment-specific and not associated with biomarker progression in medication-naive individuals. Furthermore, we demonstrate that individuals with higher genetically determined low-density and total cholesterol baseline levels experience increased absolute, albeit lower relative biomarker reduction following statin treatment. In summary, we systematically investigated the common and rare pharmacogenetic contribution to cardiometabolic drug response phenotypes in over 50,000 UK Biobank and All of Us participants with EHR and identified clinically relevant genetic predictors for improved personalized treatment strategies.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.06.24305415.abstract,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EXLA2j3tv-lNjKEjsjxgKhoB80nRTp7X_q2QPYS8UgNiVA?e=34Khiu
K_molecular_Mendelian_randomization,MR-link-2: pleiotropy robust cis Mendelian randomization validated in four independent gold-standard datasets of causality,"Adriaan van der Graaf, Robert Warmerdam, Chiara Marie Paula Auwerx, eQTLGen Consortium, Urmo Vosa, Maria Carolina Borges, Lude Franke, Zoltan Kutalik","Observational causal inference, molecular exposures, metabolomics","Mendelian randomization (MR) can identify causal relationships from observational data but has increased Type 1 error rates (T1E) when genetic instruments are limited to a single associated region, a typical scenario for molecular exposures. 
To address this, we developed MR-link-2, which uses summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) information to simultaneously estimate a causal effect and pleiotropy in a single associated region. We extensively compare MR-link-2 to other cis MR methods: i) In realistic simulations, MR-link-2 has calibrated T1E and high power. ii) We replicate causal relationships derived from three metabolic pathway references using four independent metabolite quantitative trait locus studies as input to MR. Compared to other methods, MR-link-2 has a superior area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) (up to 0.80). iii) Applied to canonical causal relationships between complex traits, MR-link-2 has a lower per-locus T1E rate than competing methods (0.09 vs 0.15, at a nominal 5% level) and has several fold less heterogeneous causal effect estimates. iv) Testing the correct causal direction between blood cell type compositions and gene expression of their marker genes reveals that MR-link has superior AUC 0.90 (best competing: 0.67). Finally, when testing for causality between metabolites that are not connected by canonical reactions, MR-link-2 exclusively identifies a link between glycine and pyrroline-5-carboxylate, corroborating results for hypomyelinating leukodystrophy-10, otherwise only found in model systems. Overall, MR-link-2 is the first method to identify pleiotropy-robust causality from summary statistics in single associated regions, making it ideally suited for applications on molecular phenotypes.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.22.24301400v1,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/Eaq1sLymZExLsGvulJ4zOncB29JZVC6IiUQQpiIfIpCVWA?e=9BB9uP
K_selection_metabolites,Widespread natural selection on metabolite levels in humans,"Yanina Timasheva, Kaido Lepik, Orsolya Liska, Balázs Papp, Zoltán Kutalik","stabilising selection, metabolomics, causal inference","Natural selection acts ubiquitously on complex human traits, predominantly constraining the occurrence of extreme phenotypes (stabilizing selection). These constrains propagate to DNA sequence variants associated with traits under selection. The genetic imprints of such evolutionary events can thus be detected via combining effect size estimates from genetic association studies and the corresponding allele frequencies. While this approach has been successfully applied to high-level traits, the prevalence and mode of selection acting on molecular traits remains poorly understood. Here, we estimate the action of natural selection on genetic variants associated with metabolite levels, an important layer of molecular traits. By leveraging summary statistics of published genome-wide association studies with large sample sizes, we find strong evidence of stabilizing selection for 15 out of 97 plasma metabolites, with an overrepresentation of amino acids among such cases. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed that metabolites under stronger stabilizing selection display larger effects on key cardiometabolic traits, suggesting that maintaining a healthy cardiometabolic profile may be an important source of selective constraints on the metabolome. Metabolites under strong stabilizing selection in humans are also more conserved in their concentrations among diverse mammalian species, suggesting shared selective forces across micro and macroevolutionary time scales. Finally, we also found evidence for both disruptive and directional selection on specific lipid metabolites, potentially indicating ongoing evolutionary adaptation in humans. Overall, this study demonstrates that variation in metabolite levels among humans is frequently shaped by natural selection and this may be acting indirectly through maintaining cardiometabolic fitness.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.07.527420v1,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.07.527420v1.full.pdf

Approaches to prioritize such genes include genome-wide association studies (GWASs), rare variant burden tests in exome sequencing studies (Exome), or integration of a GWAS with expression/protein quantitative trait loci (eQTL/pQTL-GWAS). Here, we compare gene-prioritization approaches on 30 clinically relevant traits and benchmark their ability to recover drug targets. Across traits, prioritized genes were enriched for drug targets with odds ratios (ORs) of 2.17, 2.04, 1.81, and 1.31 for the GWAS, eQTL-GWAS, Exome, and pQTL-GWAS methods, respectively. Adjusting for differences in testable genes and sample sizes, GWAS outperforms e/pQTL-GWAS, but not the Exome approach. Furthermore, performance increased through gene network diffusion, although the node degree, being the best predictor (OR = 8.7), revealed strong bias in literature-curated networks. In conclusion, we systematically assessed strategies to prioritize drug target genes, highlighting the promises and pitfalls of current approaches.",https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37492104/,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10363916/pdf/main.pdf

To evaluate the impact of selective participation, here we derived UK Biobank participation probabilities on the basis of 14 variables harmonized across the UK Biobank and a representative sample. We then conducted weighted genome-wide association analyses on 19 traits. Comparing the output from weighted genome-wide association analyses (neffective = 94,643 to 102,215) with that from standard genome-wide association analyses (n = 263,464 to 283,749), we found that increasing representativeness led to changes in SNP effect sizes and identified novel SNP associations for 12 traits. While heritability estimates were less impacted by weighting (maximum change in h2, 5%), we found substantial discrepancies for genetic correlations (maximum change in rg, 0.31) and Mendelian randomization estimates (maximum change in βSTD, 0.15) for socio-behavioural traits.

However, it is currently unclear what exactly causes this similarity-partner choice, partner influence increasing similarity over time or confounding factors such as shared environment or indirect assortment. Here, we applied Mendelian randomization to the data of 51,664 couples in the UK Biobank and investigated partner similarity in 118 traits. We found evidence of partner choice for 64 traits, 40 of which had larger phenotypic correlation than causal effect. This suggests that confounders contribute to trait similarity, among which household income, overall health rating and education accounted for 29.8, 14.1 and 11.6% of correlations between partners, respectively. Finally, mediation analysis revealed that most causal associations between different traits in the two partners are indirect.

Yet, studies focusing on parent-of-origin effects have been limited in terms of sample size due to the lack of parental genomes or known genealogies. We propose a probabilistic approach to infer the parent-of-origin of individual alleles that does not require parental genomes nor prior knowledge of genealogy. Our model uses Identity-By-Descent sharing with second- and third-degree relatives to assign alleles to parental groups and leverages chromosome X data in males to distinguish maternal from paternal groups. We combine this with robust haplotype inference and haploid imputation to infer the parent-of-origin for 26,393 UK Biobank individuals. We screen 99 phenotypes for parent-of-origin effects and replicate the discoveries of 6 GWAS studies, confirming signals on body mass index, type 2 diabetes, standing height and multiple blood biomarkers, including the known maternal effect at the MEG3/DLK1 locus on platelet phenotypes. We also report a novel maternal effect at the TERT gene on telomere length, thereby providing new insights on the heritability of this phenotype.

Sadler, Reedik Mägi, Zoltan Kutalik, Matthew R. Robinson","genomic prediction, age at onset, cancer","Genome-wide association studies seek to attribute disease risk to DNA regions and facilitate subject-specific prediction and patient stratification. For later-life diseases, inference from case-control studies is hampered by the uncertainty that control group subjects might later be diagnosed. Time-to-event analysis treats controls as right-censored, making no additional assumptions about future disease occurrence and represents a more sound conceptual alternative for more accurate inference. Here, using data on 11 common cancers from the UK and Estonian Biobank studies, we provide empirical evidence that discovery and genomic prediction are greatly improved by analysing age-at-diagnosis, compared to a case-control model of association. We replicate previous findings from large-scale case-control studies and find an additional 7 previously unreported independent genomic regions, out of which 3 replicated in independent data. Our novel discoveries provide new insights into underlying cancer pathways, and our model yields a better understanding of the polygenicity and genetic architecture of the 11 tumours. We find that heritable germline genetic variation plays a vital role in cancer occurrence, with risk attributable to many thousands of underlying genomic regions. Finally, we show that Bayesian modelling strategies utilizing time-to-event data increase prediction accuracy by an average of 20% compared to a recent summary statistic approach (LDpred-funct). As sample sizes increase, incorporating time-to-event data should be commonplace, improving case-control studies by using richer information about the disease process.",https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/89882,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elifesciences/enhanced-preprints-data/master/data/89882/v1/89882-v1.pdf
