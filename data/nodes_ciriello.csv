C_CellCharter,CellCharter reveals spatial cell niches associated with tissue remodeling and cell plasticity,"Marco Varrone, Daniele Tavernari, Albert Santamaria-Martínez, Logan A Walsh, Giovanni Ciriello","Spatial omics, cell niches, Gaussian Mixture Models, non-small cell lung cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus ","Tissues are organized in cellular niches, the composition and interactions of which can be investigated using spatial omics technologies. However, systematic analyses of tissue composition are challenged by the scale and diversity of the data. Here we present CellCharter, an algorithmic framework to identify, characterize, and compare cellular niches in spatially resolved datasets. CellCharter outperformed existing approaches and effectively identified cellular niches across datasets generated using different technologies, and comprising hundreds of samples and millions of cells. In multiple human lung cancer cohorts, CellCharter uncovered a cellular niche composed of tumor-associated neutrophil and cancer cells expressing markers of hypoxia and cell migration. This cancer cell state was spatially segregated from more proliferative tumor cell clusters and was associated with tumor-associated neutrophil infiltration and poor prognosis in independent patient cohorts. Overall, CellCharter enables systematic analyses across data types and technologies to decode the link between spatial tissue architectures and cell plasticity.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01588-4,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EXloLFXHHD9OgYR4XpRAWY8BAwzlPRtYM86Z7Odbg_HU7Q?e=n8BN63
C_doubling,Whole-genome doubling drives oncogenic loss of chromatin segregation,"Ruxandra A Lambuta, Luca Nanni, Yuanlong Liu, Juan Diaz-Miyar, Arvind Iyer, Daniele Tavernari, Natalya Katanayeva, Giovanni Ciriello, Elisa Oricchio",,"Whole-genome doubling (WGD) is a recurrent event in human cancers and it promotes chromosomal instability and acquisition of aneuploidies1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. However, the three-dimensional organization of chromatin in WGD cells and its contribution to oncogenic phenotypes are currently unknown. Here we show that in p53-deficient cells, WGD induces loss of chromatin segregation (LCS). This event is characterized by reduced segregation between short and long chromosomes, A and B subcompartments and adjacent chromatin domains. LCS is driven by the downregulation of CTCF and H3K9me3 in cells that bypassed activation of the tetraploid checkpoint. Longitudinal analyses revealed that LCS primes genomic regions for subcompartment repositioning in WGD cells. This results in chromatin and epigenetic changes associated with oncogene activation in tumours ensuing from WGD cells. Notably, subcompartment repositioning events were largely independent of chromosomal alterations, which indicates that these were complementary mechanisms contributing to tumour development and progression. Overall, LCS initiates chromatin conformation changes that ultimately result in oncogenic epigenetic and transcriptional modifications, which suggests that chromatin evolution is a hallmark of WGD-driven cancer.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05794-2,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/Edcft4Q_JhpApjwqjcBLBtYBoaYN8Zybx9nhTtuxtoI2FA?e=XEY8dC
C_epistasis,Epistasis and evolutionary dependencies in human cancers,"Marco Mina, Arvind Iyer, Giovanni Ciriello",,"Cancer evolution is driven by the concerted action of multiple molecular alterations, which emerge and are selected during tumor progression. An alteration is selected when it provides an advantage to the tumor cell. However, the advantage provided by a specific alteration depends on the tumor lineage, cell epigenetic state, and presence of additional alterations. In this case, we say that an evolutionary dependency exists between an alteration and what influences its selection. Epistatic interactions between altered genes lead to evolutionary dependencies (EDs), by favoring or vetoing specific combinations of events. Large-scale cancer genomics studies have discovered examples of such dependencies, and showed that they influence tumor progression, disease phenotypes, and therapeutic response. In the past decade, several algorithmic approaches have been proposed to infer EDs from large-scale genomics datasets. These methods adopt diverse strategies to address common challenges and shed new light on cancer evolutionary trajectories. Here, we review these efforts starting from a simple conceptualization of the problem, presenting the tackled and still unmet needs in the field, and discussing the implications of EDs in cancer biology and precision oncology.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959437X22000983,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EZJJPKvrbPpCkb8SSMNm-4gBdWJ17w-IeX5ZrjbFvbh8mw?e=6xNvaC
C_TAD,Methods for the Analysis of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs),"Marie Zufferey, Daniele Tavernari, Giovanni Ciriello",,"Chromatin folding in the 3D space of the nucleus can be explored through high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) approaches. These experiments quantify the number of interactions between any pair of genomic loci in the genome and, thus, allow building genome-scale maps of intra- and inter-chromosomal contacts (contact maps). Statistical and algorithmic analyses of Hi-C data consist in extracting information from these contact maps. One of the most striking patterns observed in intra-chromosomal Hi-C contact maps emerged from genomic regions that exhibit dense intra-region but sparse inter-region contacts. These have been termed topologically associating domains (TADs). The identification of TADs from Hi-C contact maps is of great interest as they have been shown to act as unit of chromosome organization and, potentially, functional activity. Several approaches have been developed to identify TADs (TAD callers). However, results from these methods are often dependent on data resolution and poorly concordant. In this chapter, we present four TAD callers and we provide detailed protocols for their use. In addition, we show how to compare TADs identified by different callers and how to assess the enrichment for TAD-associated biological features. TAD calling has become a key step in the study of chromatin 3D organization in different cellular contexts. Here we provide guidelines to improve the robustness and quality of these analyses.",https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007/978-1-0716-1390-0_3,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EeoY0Tqb_IhIqgu9MdTQb28B6iQDnlf3gejK39JR7xRH-A?e=rIolqJ
C_coregulation,"Systematic
 assessment of gene co-regulation within chromatin domains determines 
differentially active domains across human cancers","Marie Zufferey, Yuanlong Liu, Daniele Tavernari, Marco Mina, Giovanni Ciriello",,"Spatial interactions and insulation of chromatin regions are associated with transcriptional regulation. Domains of frequent chromatin contacts are proposed as functional units, favoring and delimiting gene regulatory interactions. However, contrasting evidence supports the association between chromatin domains and transcription.Here, we assess gene co-regulation in chromatin domains across multiple human cancers, which exhibit great transcriptional heterogeneity. Across all datasets, gene co-regulation is observed only within a small yet significant number of chromatin domains. We design an algorithmic approach to identify differentially active domains (DADo) between two conditions and show that these provide complementary information to differentially expressed genes. Domains comprising co-regulated genes are enriched in the less active B sub-compartments and for genes with similar function. Notably, differential activation of chromatin domains is not associated with major changes of domain boundaries, but rather with changes of sub-compartments and intra-domain contacts. Overall, gene co-regulation is observed only in a minority of chromatin domains, whose systematic identification will help unravel the relationship between chromatin structure and transcription.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13059-021-02436-6,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EQjgE_6hlShBu1bN-VgGXsMBarmZYIDI_bjLx3SLAwxtIw?e=f1Hhng
C_Histone,Histone acetylation dynamics modulates chromatin conformation and allele-specific interactions at oncogenic loci,"Stephanie Sungalee, Yuanlong Liu, Ruxandra A Lambuta, Natalya Katanayeva, Maria Donaldson Collier, Daniele Tavernari, Sandrine Roulland, Giovanni Ciriello, Elisa Oricchio",,"In cancer cells, enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal alterations and/or increased deposition of acetylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) can support oncogene expression. However, how the chromatin conformation of enhancer–promoter interactions is affected by these events is unclear. In the present study, by comparing chromatin structure and H3K27ac levels in normal and lymphoma B cells, we show that enhancer–promoter-interacting regions assume different conformations according to the local abundance of H3K27ac. Genetic or pharmacological depletion of H3K27ac decreases the frequency and the spreading of these interactions, altering oncogene expression. Moreover, enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal translocations influences the epigenetic status of the regions flanking the breakpoint, prompting the formation of distinct intrachromosomal interactions in the two homologous chromosomes. These interactions are accompanied by allele-specific gene expression changes. Overall, our work indicates that H3K27ac dynamics modulates interaction frequency between regulatory regions and can lead to allele-specific chromatin configurations to sustain oncogene expression.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-021-00842-x,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EWToWYyiVfxAqoS9lYsyq_IB5KKKMq50BIQ-GPYlRtsgLQ?e=xzxmPb

In lung adenocarcinoma, disease progression and prognosis are associated with the appearance of morphologically diverse tumor regions, termed histologic patterns. However, the link between molecular and histologic features remains elusive. Here, we generated multiomics and spatially resolved molecular profiles of histologic patterns from primary lung adenocarcinoma, which we integrated with molecular data from >2,000 patients. The transition from indolent to aggressive patterns was not driven by genetic alterations but by epigenetic and transcriptional reprogramming reshaping cancer cell identity. A signature quantifying this transition was an independent predictor of patient prognosis in multiple human cohorts. Within individual tumors, highly multiplexed protein spatial profiling revealed coexistence of immune desert, inflamed, and excluded regions, which matched histologic pattern composition. Our results provide a detailed molecular map of lung adenocarcinoma intratumor spatial heterogeneity, tracing nongenetic routes of cancer evolution.",https://aacrjournals.org/cancerdiscovery/article/11/6/1490/666581/Nongenetic-Evolution-Drives-Lung-Adenocarcinoma,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EY4JwDNmGGdEjRnqrQjlOE4BwVSJBCPUYb3QrV2Ks2vm6A?e=uqKSH7
C_dependencies,Discovering functional evolutionary dependencies in human cancers,"Marco Mina, Arvind Iyer, Daniele Tavernari, Franck Raynaud, Giovanni Ciriello",,"Cancer cells retain genomic alterations that provide a selective advantage. The prediction and validation of advantageous alterations are major challenges in cancer genomics. Moreover, it is crucial to understand how the coexistence of specific alterations alters response to genetic and therapeutic perturbations. In the present study, we inferred functional alterations and preferentially selected combinations of events in >9,000 human tumors. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we validated computational predictions with high-throughput readouts from genetic and pharmacological screenings on 2,000 cancer cell lines. Mutually exclusive and co-occurring cancer alterations reflected, respectively, functional redundancies able to rescue the phenotype of individual target inhibition, or synergistic interactions, increasing oncogene addiction. Among the top scoring dependencies, co-alteration of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) subunit PIK3CA and the nuclear factor NFE2L2 was a synergistic evolutionary trajectory in squamous cell carcinomas. By integrating computational, experimental and clinical evidence, we provide a framework to study the combinatorial functional effects of cancer genomic alterations.",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0703-5,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EaBFvHRdP-dGnCjSrqV29w8Bq52h7DWya3PYTux3syLpVA?e=zfGdch
C_topological,Comparison of computational methods for the identification of topologically associating domains,"Marie Zufferey, Daniele Tavernari, Elisa Oricchio, Giovanni Ciriello",,"Chromatin folding gives rise to structural elements among which are clusters of densely interacting DNA regions termed topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs have been characterized across multiple species, tissue types, and differentiation stages, sometimes in association with regulation of biological functions. The reliability and reproducibility of these findings are intrinsically related with the correct identification of these domains from high-throughput chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) experiments. Here, we test and compare 22 computational methods to identify TADs across 20 different conditions. We find that TAD sizes and numbers vary significantly among callers and data resolutions, challenging the definition of an average TAD size, but strengthening the hypothesis that TADs are hierarchically organized domains, rather than disjoint structural elements. Performances of these methods differ based on data resolution and normalization strategy, but a core set of TAD callers consistently retrieve reproducible domains, even at low sequencing depths, that are enriched for TAD-associated biological features. This study provides a reference for the analysis of chromatin domains from Hi-C experiments and useful guidelines for choosing a suitable approach based on the experimental design, available data, and biological question of interest.",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13059-018-1596-9,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EZlknyFCJ4pHh4pCdN52jdcB2_ACEdfqYyua0SRejI0BKQ?e=9ZexLm
C_pan_cancer,Pan-cancer inference of intra-tumor heterogeneity reveals associations with different forms of genomic instability,"Franck Raynaud, Marco Mina, Daniele Tavernari, Giovanni Ciriello",,"Genomic instability is a major driver of intra-tumor heterogeneity. However, unstable genomes often exhibit different molecular and clinical phenotypes, which are associated with distinct mutational processes. Here, we algorithmically inferred the clonal phylogenies of ~6,000 human tumors from 32 tumor types to explore how intra-tumor heterogeneity depends on different implementations of genomic instability. We found that extremely unstable tumors associated with DNA repair deficiencies or high chromosomal instability are not the most intrinsically heterogeneous. Conversely, intra-tumor heterogeneity is greatest in tumors exhibiting relatively high numbers of both mutations and copy number alterations, a feature often observed in cancers associated with exogenous mutagens. Independently of the type of instability, tumors with high number of clones invariably evolved through branching phylogenies that could be stratified based on the extent of clonal (early) and subclonal (late) instability. Interestingly, tumors with high number of subclonal mutations frequently exhibited chromosomal instability, TP53 mutations, and APOBEC-related mutational signatures. Vice versa, mutations of chromatin remodeling genes often characterized tumors with few subclonal but multiple clonal mutations. Understanding how intra-tumor heterogeneity depends on genomic instability is critical to identify markers predictive of the tumor complexity and envision therapeutic strategies able to exploit this association.",https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007669,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EYNusTvlMXZPjrLoPK029qUBtJ94GgBknS0SLfTxTVfByA?e=L3cRs4
