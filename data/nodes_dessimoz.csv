Altenhoff, Christophe Dessimoz",Orthology; Scalability; Phylogenomics; Parallel computing,"The surge in genome data, with ongoing efforts aiming to sequence 1.5M eukaryotes in a decade, could revolutionise genomics, revealing the origins, evolution, and genetic innovations of biological processes. Yet, traditional genomics methods scale poorly with such large datasets. Addressing this, “FastOMA” provides linear scalability, enabling the processing of thousands of eukaryotic genomes within a day. FastOMA maintains the high accuracy and resolution of the well-established OMA approach in benchmarks.

D_FoldTree,"Structural phylogenetics unravels the evolutionary diversification of communication systems in gram-positive bacteria and their viruses
","David Moi, Charles Bernard, Martin Steinegger, Yannis Nevers, Mauricio Langleib, Christophe Dessimoz
",Protein structure; AlphaFold; Phylogenetics,"Recent advances in AI-based protein structure modeling have yielded remarkable progress in predicting protein structures. Since structures are constrained by their biological function, their geometry tends to evolve more slowly than the underlying amino acids sequences. This feature of structures could in principle be used to reconstruct phylogenetic trees over longer evolutionary timescales than sequence-based approaches, but until now a reliable structure-based tree building method has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the use of structure-based phylogenies can outperform sequence-based ones not only for distantly related proteins but also, remarkably, for more closely related ones. This is achieved by inferring trees from protein structures using a local structural alphabet, an approach robust to conformational changes that confound traditional structural distance measures. As an illustration, we used structures to decipher the evolutionary diversification of a particularly challenging family: the fast-evolving RRNPPA quorum sensing receptors enabling gram-positive bacteria, plasmids and bacteriophages to communicate and coordinate key behaviors such as sporulation, virulence, antibiotic resistance, conjugation or phage lysis/lysogeny decision. The advent of high-accuracy structural phylogenetics enables myriad of applications across biology, such as uncovering deeper evolutionary relationships, elucidating unknown protein functions, or refining the design of bioengineered molecules.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.19.558401,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EQZzdQ-bzONKsgMzlt-IO6MB-_AGDMm0vtlKdB3LXP8pDQ?e=1M7zhM
D_OMArk,Quality assessment of gene repertoire annotations with OMArk,"Yannis Nevers, Alex Warwick Vesztrocy, Victor Rossier, Clément-Marie Train, Adrian Altenhoff, Christophe Dessimoz & Natasha M. Glover ",Data QC; Genome annotation; Contamination; Systematic bias,"In the era of biodiversity genomics, it is crucial to ensure that annotations of protein-coding gene repertoires are accurate. State-of-the-art tools to assess genome annotations measure the completeness of a gene repertoire but are blind to other errors, such as gene overprediction or contamination. We introduce OMArk, a software package that relies on fast, alignment-free sequence comparisons between a query proteome and precomputed gene families across the tree of life. OMArk assesses not only the completeness but also the consistency of the gene repertoire as a whole relative to closely related species and reports likely contamination events. Analysis of 1,805 UniProt Eukaryotic Reference Proteomes with OMArk demonstrated strong evidence of contamination in 73 proteomes and identified error propagation in avian gene annotation resulting from the use of a fragmented zebra finch proteome as a reference. This study illustrates the importance of comparing and prioritizing proteomes based on their quality measures.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-024-02147-w,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/Eb9zbM4t1QFCgsYITMBIc5gBp2MRPMfnHJSwR2XcA0VxdA?e=wKocDf
D_Read2Tree,"Inference of phylogenetic trees directly from raw sequencing reads using Read2Tree
","David Dylus, Adrian Altenhoff, Sina Majidian, Fritz J Sedlazeck, Christophe Dessimoz
",Phylogenetics; Sequencing,"Current methods for inference of phylogenetic trees require running complex pipelines at substantial computational and labor costs, with additional constraints in sequencing coverage, assembly and annotation quality, especially for large datasets. To overcome these challenges, we present Read2Tree, which directly processes raw sequencing reads into groups of corresponding genes and bypasses traditional steps in phylogeny inference, such as genome assembly, annotation and all-versus-all sequence comparisons, while retaining accuracy. In a benchmark encompassing a broad variety of datasets, Read2Tree is 10–100 times faster than assembly-based approaches and in most cases more accurate—the exception being when sequencing coverage is high and reference species very distant. Here, to illustrate the broad applicability of the tool, we reconstruct a yeast tree of life of 435 species spanning 590 million years of evolution. We also apply Read2Tree to >10,000 Coronaviridae samples, accurately classifying highly diverse animal samples and near-identical severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sequences on a single tree. The speed, accuracy and versatility of Read2Tree enable comparative genomics at scale.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-023-01753-4,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EcObSGyl7pxAv8SW87y7tfoBT_Ijh881j4biltyQ8hNNJQ?e=Vo0pam
D_OMA,"OMA orthology in 2024: improved prokaryote coverage, ancestral and extant GO enrichment, a revamped synteny viewer and more in the OMA Ecosystem","Altenhoff AM, Warwick Vesztrocy A, Bernard C, Train CM, Nicheperovich A, Prieto Baños S, Julca I, Moi D, Nevers Y, Majidian S, Dessimoz C, Glover NM",,"In this update paper, we present the latest developments in the OMA browser knowledgebase, which aims to provide high-quality orthology inferences and facilitate the study of gene families, genomes and their evolution. First, we discuss the addition of new species in the database, particularly an expanded representation of prokaryotic species. The OMA browser now offers Ancestral Genome pages and an Ancestral Gene Order viewer, allowing users to explore the evolutionary history and gene content of ancestral genomes. We also introduce a revamped Local Synteny Viewer to compare genomic neighborhoods across both extant and ancestral genomes. Hierarchical Orthologous Groups (HOGs) are now annotated with Gene Ontology annotations, and users can easily perform extant or ancestral GO enrichments. Finally, we recap new tools in the OMA Ecosystem, including OMAmer for proteome mapping, OMArk for proteome quality assessment, OMAMO for model organism selection and Read2Tree for phylogenetic species tree construction from reads. These new features provide exciting opportunities for orthology analysis and comparative genomics.
