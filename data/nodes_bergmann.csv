Using a fully automated image processing pipeline, we extracted 17 different morphological vascular phenotypes, including median vessels diameter, diameter variability, main temporal angles, vascular density, central retinal equivalents, the number of bifurcations, and tortuosity, from over 130k fundus images of close to 72k UK Biobank subjects. We performed Genome-Wide Association Studies of these phenotypes. From this, we estimated their heritabilities, ranging between 5 and 25%, and genetic cross-phenotype correlations, which mostly mirrored the corresponding phenotypic correlations, but tended to be slightly larger. Projecting our genetic association signals onto genes and pathways revealed remarkably low overlap suggesting largely decoupled mechanisms modulating the different phenotypes. Our disease phenotype associations confirmed some previously known findings and revealed many novel connections. Notably, diameter variability, especially for the veins, seems to have new and interesting associations with diseases, including heart attack, pulmonary embolism, and age of death. Mendelian Randomization analysis suggests a causal influence of blood pressure and body mass index on retinal vessel morphology, among other results. We validated key findings in two independent smaller cohorts. Our analyses provide evidence that large-scale analysis of image-derived vascular phenotypes has sufficient power for obtaining functional, as well as some initial causal insights into the processes modulating the retinal vasculature.",https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.07.23292368v2,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EeBemntJRUtIsgpI4lnljokB93YQv6kvgWIueaN5JG9TYg?e=f0hU7R
B_GWAS,Genome-wide Association Studies of Retinal Vessel Tortuosity Identify Numerous Novel Loci Revealing Genes and Pathways Associated With Ocular and Cardiometabolic Diseases,"Mattia Tomasoni, Michael Johannes Beyeler, Sofia Ortin Vela, Ninon Mounier, Eleonora Porcu, Tanguy Corre, Daniel Krefl, Alexander Luke Button, Hana Abouzeid, Konstantinidis Lazaros, Murielle Bochud, Reinier Schlingemann, Ciara Bergin, Sven Bergmann","Deep learning, GWAS, retina, vasculature, genes, pathways, diseases","Purpose: To identify novel susceptibility loci for retinal vascular tortuosity, to better understand the molecular mechanisms modulating this trait, and reveal causal relationships with diseases and their risk factors.
Design: Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) of vascular tortuosity of retinal arteries and veins fol- lowed by replication meta-analysis and Mendelian randomization (MR).
Participants: We analyzed 116 639 fundus images of suitable quality from 63 662 participants from 3 co- horts, namely the UK Biobank (n 1⁄4 62 751), the Swiss Kidney Project on Genes in Hypertension (n 1⁄4 397), and OphtalmoLaus (n 1⁄4 512).
Methods: Using a fully automated retina image processing pipeline to annotate vessels and a deep learning algorithm to determine the vessel type, we computed the median arterial, venous and combined vessel tortuosity measured by the distance factor (the length of a vessel segment over its chord length), as well as by 6 alternative measures that integrate over vessel curvature. We then performed the largest GWAS of these traits to date and assessed gene set enrichment using the novel high-precision statistical method PascalX.
Main Outcome Measure: We evaluated the genetic association of retinal tortuosity, measured by the dis- tance factor.
Results: Higher retinal tortuosity was significantly associated with higher incidence of angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and hypertension. We identified 175 significantly associated genetic loci in the UK Biobank; 173 of these were novel and 4 replicated in our second, much smaller, metacohort. We estimated heritability at w25% using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Vessel type specific GWAS revealed 116 loci for arteries and 63 for veins. Genes with significant association signals included COL4A2, ACTN4, LGALS4, LGALS7, LGALS7B, TNS1, MAP4K1, EIF3K, CAPN12, ECH1, and SYNPO2. These tortuosity genes were overexpressed in arteries and heart muscle and linked to pathways related to the structural properties of the vasculature. We demon- strated that retinal tortuosity loci served pleiotropic functions as cardiometabolic disease variants and risk factors. Concordantly, MR revealed causal effects between tortuosity, body mass index, and low-density lipoprotein.
Conclusions: Several alleles associated with retinal vessel tortuosity suggest a common genetic architecture of this trait with ocular diseases (glaucoma, myopia), cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome. Our results shed new light on the genetics of vascular diseases and their pathomechanisms and highlight how GWASs and heritability can be used to improve phenotype extraction from high-dimensional data, such as images.",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666914523000209,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EcBO100JYJJDpvVkXr2U6u0BG0u6pTmxP5wr8IiqvUa_Rg?e=DF8tzQ
B_pathway,Cross-GWAS coherence test at the gene and pathway level,"Daniel Krefl, Sven Bergmann ","GWAS, genes, pathways,  cross-GWAS ","Proximal genetic variants are frequently correlated, implying that the corresponding effect sizes detected by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are also not independent. Methods already exist to account for this when aggregating effects from a single GWAS across genes or pathways. Here we present a rigorous yet fast method for detecting genes with coherent association signals for two traits, facilitating cross-GWAS analyses. To this end, we devised a new significance test for the covariance of datapoints not drawn independently but with a known inter-sample covariance structure. We show that the distribution of its test statistic is a linear combination of χ2 distributions with positive and negative coefficients. The corresponding cumulative distribution function can be efficiently calculated with Davies’ algorithm at high precision. We apply this general framework to test for dependence between SNP-wise effect sizes of two GWAS at the gene level. We extend this test to detect also gene-wise causal links. We demonstrate the utility of our method by uncovering potential shared genetic links between the severity of COVID-19 and (1) being prescribed class M05B medication (drugs affecting bone structure and mineralization), (2) rheumatoid arthritis, (3) vitamin D (25OHD), and (4) serum calcium concentrations. Our method detects a potential role played by chemokine receptor genes linked to TH1 versus TH2 immune response, a gene related to integrin beta-1 cell surface expression, and other genes potentially impacting the severity of COVID-19. Our approach will be useful for similar analyses involving datapoints with known auto-correlation structures.",https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010517,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EftRO31Jn9FJhlk4fUoRiUkBcvq0qyVqR_BMBdOHYnKd6w?e=Bm294J
