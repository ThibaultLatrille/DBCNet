F_SNARE,A look beyond the QR code of SNARE proteins,"Deepak Yadav,  Aysima Hacisuleyman, Mykola Dergai, Dany Khalifeh,  Luciano Andres Abriata,  Matteo Dal Peraro,  Dirk Fasshauer","SNARE proteins, Molecular dynamics","Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor (SNARE) proteins catalyze the fusion process of vesicles with target membranes in eukaryotic cells. To do this, they assemble in a zipper-like fashion into stable complexes between the membranes. Structural studies have shown that the complexes consist of four different helices, which we subdivide into Qa-, Qb-, Qc-, and R-helix on the basis of their sequence signatures. Using a combination of biochemistry, modeling and molecular dynamics, we investigated how the four different types are arranged in a complex. We found that there is a matching pattern in the core of the complex that dictates the position of the four fundamental SNARE types in the bundle, resulting in a QabcR complex. In the cell, several different cognate QabcR-SNARE complexes catalyze the different transport steps between the compartments of the endomembrane system. Each of these cognate QabcR complexes is compiled from a repertoire of about 20 SNARE subtypes. Our studies show that exchange within the four types is largely tolerated structurally, although some non-cognate exchanges lead to structural imbalances. This suggests that SNARE complexes have evolved for a catalytic mechanism, a mechanism that leaves little scope for selectivity beyond the QabcR rule.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.24.590896v1,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EQkDHJo6KmpKsjnh1taDfcsBrgNaguyYTA19kUPhFNV6MQ?e=NYSR4K
F_mutual_information,Role of Mutual Information Profile Shifts in Assessing the Pathoenicity of Mutations on Protein Functions: The case of Pyrin Mutations,"Aysima Hacisuleyman, Ahmet Gul, Burak Erman","Mutual information, molecular dynamics, pathogenicity, protein mutations, affinity prediction","This paper presents a novel method to assess the pathogenicity of mutations by affecting a phenotype and/or its severity, with a specific emphasis on the role of mutual information (MI) as a measure to quantify the correlation between residue motions or fluctuations. The concept of MI profile shift is presented to quantify changes in MI upon mutation, revealing insights into residue-residue interactions. We apply this method to the case of Pyrin protein variants, which are associated with an autosomal recessively inherited disease called familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), since the available tools do not help predict the pathogenicity of the most penetrant variants. We demonstrate the utility of MI profile shifts in assessing the effects of mutations on protein stability, function, and disease phenotype. The importance of negative MI shifts as indicators of severe effects is emphasized, along with exploring potential compensatory mechanisms indicated by positive MI shifts, which are otherwise random and inconsequential. The paper also discusses challenges in relating MI profile changes to disease severity and advocates for comprehensive analysis considering genetic, environmental, and stochastic factors. Overall, this study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression and offers a framework for identifying potential therapeutic targets based on MI profile changes induced by mutations.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.07.588500v1,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EVNFKGos1pFMr-vLpTnCSfkBLUqEqw1Hdp95DLET28yF0w?e=8mCKaF
F_Munc18,Exploring the conformational changes of the Munc18‐1/syntaxin 1a complex,"Ioanna Stefani, Justyna Iwaszkiewicz, Dirk Fasshauer","Munc13,Munc18-1,neuronalsecretion,SMprotein,SNAREprotein,synaptobrevin, syntaxin-1a","Neurotransmitters are released from synaptic vesicles, the membrane of which fuses with the plasma membrane upon calcium influx. This membrane fusion reaction is driven by the formation of a tight complex comprising the plasma membrane N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins syntaxin-1a and SNAP-25 with the vesicle SNARE protein synaptobrevin. The neuronal protein Munc18-1 forms a stable complex with syntaxin-1a. Biochemically, syntaxin-1a cannot escape the tight grip of Munc18-1, so formation of the SNARE complex is inhibited. However, Munc18-1 is essential for the release of neurotransmitters in vivo. It has therefore been assumed that Munc18-1 makes the bound syntaxin-1a available for SNARE complex formation. Exactly how this occurs is still unclear, but it is assumed that structural rearrangements occur. Here, we used a series of mutations to specifically weaken the complex at different positions in order to induce these rearrangements biochemically. Our approach was guided through sequence and structural analysis and supported by molecular dynamics simulations. Subsequently, we created a homology model showing the complex in an altered conformation. This conformation presumably represents a more open arrangement of syntaxin-1a that permits the formation of a SNARE complex to be initiated while still bound to Munc18-1. In the future, research should investigate how this central reaction for neuronal communication is controlled by other proteins.",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pro.4870,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EWAp1HS7XWBMr3T5mon1accB_Lar6mgbUPna-EG7I1dM8g?e=96Vfjd
F_lncRNA_cancer_transcriptomics,Multi-hallmark long noncoding RNA maps reveal non-small cell lung cancer vulnerabilities ,"Roberta Esposito, Taisia Polidori, Carlos Pulido-Quetglas, Rory Johnson","CRISPR, lncRNA, long noncoding RNA, cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, NSCLC, RNA therapeutics, antisense oligonucleotides","Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are widely dysregulated in cancer, yet their functional roles in cancer hallmarks remain unclear. We employ pooled CRISPR deletion to perturb 831 lncRNAs detected in KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and measure their contribution to proliferation, chemoresistance, and migration across two cell backgrounds. Integrative analysis of these data outperforms conventional “dropout” screens in identifying cancer genes while prioritizing disease-relevant lncRNAs with pleiotropic and background-independent roles. Altogether, 80 high-confidence oncogenic lncRNAs are active in NSCLC, which tend to be amplified and overexpressed in tumors. A follow-up antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) screen shortlisted two candidates, Cancer Hallmarks in Lung LncRNA 1 (CHiLL1) and GCAWKR, whose knockdown consistently suppressed cancer hallmarks in two- and three-dimension tumor models. Molecular phenotyping reveals that CHiLL1 and GCAWKR control cellular-level phenotypes via distinct transcriptional networks. This work reveals a multi-dimensional functional lncRNA landscape underlying NSCLC that contains potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9903773/,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EWScD1Kt3mlNiMIQBvb5c-MBf2RCrnQ2No7GRFYRG3Zofw?e=HyoHxR
F_arachidonic_acid,Arachidonic acid does not grease the exocytotic SNARE machinery ,Dirk Fasshauer,"arachidonic acid, SNARE protein, syntaxin 3, neurite outgrowth ","It has been proposed that arachidonic acid stimulates neurite outgrowth by specifically activating syntaxin 3, a SNARE proteins that mediates the fusion of transport vesicles with the plasma membrane and is thus instrumental for the insertion of new membrane needed for cell growth and proliferation. Considering the important role of arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids for human health, these findings would have wide implications for everyday life. Here, I have report that the effect of arachidonic acid is caused by a nonspecific, detergent-like action on SNARE proteins in vitro. The action requires unphysiologically high concentrations, is mimicked by several detergents or detergent-like substances forming micelles regardless of whether arachidonic acid is present or not, and is thus highly unlikely to be of any physiological significance for SNARE function.",https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.02.06.527244v1.abstract,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/Ecka7iU7jaNPmZ9LFgSRDw8BGC8CNu20ChIIOchvQvLwIg?e=PNP3KL
F_allosteric,Unveiling Conserved Allosteric Hot Spots in Protein Domains from Sequences,"Aysima Hacisuleyman, Dirk Fasshauer","allosteric mechanisms, entropy transfer, DHFR, PDZ, SH3, S100, pattern matching, dGNM.","The amino acid sequence determines the structure, function, and dynamics of a protein. In recent years, enormous progress has been made in translating sequence information into 3D structural information using artificial intelligence. However, because of the underlying methodology, it is an immense computational challenge to extract this information from the ever-increasing number of sequences. In the present study, we show that it is possible to create 2D contact maps from sequences, for which only a few exemplary structures are available on a laptop without the need for GPUs. This is achieved by using a pattern-matching approach. The resulting contact maps largely reflect the interactions in the 3D structures. This approach was used to explore the evolutionarily conserved allosteric mechanisms and identify the source–sink (driver-driven) relationships by using an established method that combines Schreiber’s concept of entropy transfer with a simple Gaussian network model. The validity of our method was tested on the DHFR, PDZ, SH3, and S100 domains, with our predictions consistently aligning with the experimental findings.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.05.13.593877,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.13.593877v1.full.pdf
