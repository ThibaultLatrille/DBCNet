M_reference_panels,A resampling-based approach to share reference panels,"Théo Cavinato, Simone Rubinacci, Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas & Olivier Delaneau","imputation, reference panel, data privacy","For many genome-wide association studies, imputing genotypes from a haplotype reference panel is a necessary step. Over the past 15 years, reference panels have become larger and more diverse, leading to improvements in imputation accuracy. However, the latest generation of reference panels is subject to restrictions on data sharing due to concerns about privacy, limiting their usefulness for genotype imputation. In this context, here we propose RESHAPE, a method that employs a recombination Poisson process on a reference panel to simulate the genomes of hypothetical descendants after multiple generations. This data transformation helps to protect against re-identification threats and preserves data attributes, such as linkage disequilibrium patterns and, to some degree, identity-by-descent sharing, allowing for genotype imputation. Our experiments on gold-standard datasets show that simulated descendants up to eight generations can serve as reference panels without substantially reducing genotype imputation accuracy.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s43588-024-00630-7,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/ETdd_TEIhvRDlNT_pXGJPD8B1XqDvRGQLqOCWCYhE_tbsw?e=QDZglB
M_paleogenomes,Pre-processing of paleogenomes: Mitigating reference bias and postmortem damage in ancient genome data,"Dilek Koptekin, Etka Yapar, Kıvılcım Başak Vural, Ekin Sağlıcan, N Ezgi Altınışık, Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas, Can Alkan, Mehmet Somel",,"Ancient DNA analysis is subject to various technical challenges, including bias towards the reference allele (""reference bias""), postmortem damage (PMD) that confounds real variants, and limited coverage. Here, we conduct a systematic comparison of alternative approaches against reference bias and against PMD. To reduce reference bias, we either (a) mask variable sites before alignment or (b) align the data to a graph genome representing all variable sites. Compared to alignment to the linear reference genome, both masking and graph alignment effectively remove allelic bias when using simulated or real ancient human genome data, but only if sequencing data is available in FASTQ or unfiltered BAM format. Reference bias remains indelible in quality-filtered BAM files and in 1240K-capture data. We next study three approaches to overcome postmortem damage: (a) trimming, (b) rescaling base qualities, and (c) a new algorithm we present here, bamRefine, which masks only PMD-vulnerable polymorphic sites. We find that bamRefine is optimal in increasing the number of genotyped loci up to 20% compared to trimming and in improving accuracy compared to rescaling. We propose graph alignment coupled with bamRefine to minimise data loss and bias. We also urge the paleogenomics community to publish FASTQ files.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.11.566695,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EZeQoNvH_p9Klb864KbPSkIBl3XIMX5KxI1NMoq74Tabuw?e=kMwYXg
M_contamination,Assessing the impact of post-mortem damage and contamination on imputation performance in ancient DNA,"Antonio Garrido Marques, Simone Rubinacci, Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas, Olivier Delaneau, Bárbara Sousa da Mota",,"Low-coverage imputation is becoming ever more present in ancient DNA (aDNA) studies. Imputation pipelines commonly used for present-day genomes have been shown to yield accurate results when applied to ancient genomes. However, post-mortem damage (PMD), in the form of C-to-T substitutions at the reads termini, and contamination with DNA from closely related species can potentially affect imputation performance in aDNA. In this study, we evaluated imputation performance (i) when using a genotype caller designed for aDNA, ATLAS, compared to bcftools, and (ii) when contamination is present. We evaluated imputation performance with principal component analyses and by calculating imputation error rates. With a particular focus on differently imputed sites, we found that using ATLAS prior to imputation substantially improved imputed genotypes for a very damaged ancient genome (42% PMD). Trimming the ends of the sequencing reads led to similar improvements in imputation accuracy. For the remaining genomes, ATLAS brought limited gains. Finally, to examine the effect of contamination on imputation, we added various amounts of reads from two present-day genomes to a previously downsampled high-coverage ancient genome. We observed that imputation accuracy drastically decreased for contamination rates above 5%. In conclusion, we recommend (i) accounting for PMD by either trimming sequencing reads or using a genotype caller such as ATLAS before imputing highly damaged genomes and (ii) only imputing genomes containing up to 5% of contamination.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-024-56584-3,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EQ5iCNSl7NlCmi5J3g0VVJgBGm8HA7yAWjb0ZaBf76kxWg?e=OCeSPO

Amorim, Martin Sikora, Niels N Johannsen, Marzena H Szmyt, Piotr Włodarczak, Anita Szczepanek, Marcin M Przybyła, Hannes Schroeder, Morten E Allentoft, Eske Willerslev, Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas, Olivier Delaneau",,"Due to postmortem DNA degradation and microbial colonization, most ancient genomes have low depth of coverage, hindering genotype calling. Genotype imputation can improve genotyping accuracy for low-coverage genomes. However, it is unknown how accurate ancient DNA imputation is and whether imputation introduces bias to downstream analyses. Here we re-sequence an ancient trio (mother, father, son) and downsample and impute a total of 43 ancient genomes, including 42 high-coverage (above 10x) genomes. We assess imputation accuracy across ancestries, time, depth of coverage, and sequencing technology. We find that ancient and modern DNA imputation accuracies are comparable. When downsampled at 1x, 36 of the 42 genomes are imputed with low error rates (below 5%) while African genomes have higher error rates. We validate imputation and phasing results using the ancient trio data and an orthogonal approach based on Mendel’s rules of inheritance. We further compare the downstream analysis results between imputed and high-coverage genomes, notably principal component analysis, genetic clustering, and runs of homozygosity, observing similar results starting from 0.5x coverage, except for the African genomes. These results suggest that, for most populations and depths of coverage as low as 0.5x, imputation is a reliable method that can improve ancient DNA studies.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39202-0,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EYqcSF-cEEdApeVJyhovg1wBtAJutYUoUA0XUn6YUcSNdQ?e=Cde3dF
M_mapache,Mapache: a flexible pipeline to map ancient DNA ,"Samuel Neuenschwander, Diana I Cruz Dávalos, Lucas Anchieri, Bárbara Sousa da Mota, Davide Bozzi, Simone Rubinacci, Olivier Delaneau, Simon Rasmussen, Anna-Sapfo Malaspinas",,"We introduce mapache, a flexible, robust and scalable pipeline to map, quantify and impute ancient and present-day DNA in a reproducible way.
