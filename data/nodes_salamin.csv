Species diversification","Clownfish (subfamily Amphiprioninae) are an iconic group of coral reef fish that evolved a mutualistic interaction with sea anemones, which triggered the adaptive radiation of the clade. Within clownfishes, the ""skunk complex"" is particularly interesting. Besides ecological speciation, interspecific gene flow and hybrid speciation are thought to have shaped the evolution of the group. We investigated the mechanisms characterizing the diversification of this complex. By taking advantage of their disjunct geographical distribution, we obtained whole-genome data of sympatric and allopatric populations of the three main species of the complex (Amphiprion akallopisos, A. perideraion and A. sandaracinos). We examined population structure, genomic divergence and introgression signals and performed demographic modelling to identify the most realistic diversification scenario. We excluded scenarios of strict isolation or hybrid origin of A. sandaracinos. We discovered moderate gene flow from A. perideraion to the ancestor of A. akallopisos+ A. sandaracinos and weak gene flow between the species in the Indo-Australian Archipelago throughout the diversification of the group. We identified introgressed regions in A. sandaracinos and detected in A. perideraion two large regions of high divergence from the two other species. While we found that gene flow has occurred throughout the species' diversification, we also observed that recent admixture was less pervasive than initially thought, suggesting a role of host repartition or behavioural barriers in maintaining the genetic identity of the species in sympatry.",https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.17347,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EYyXJ8aPnhVBotRNCsUGP3ABdbGm8sM4tWZgUR1SIV1aaA?e=eU4UUd

Species diversification","Hybrid zones - locations where genetically distinct lineages interact and reproduce - are remarkable resources for exploring the evolutionary trajectory of species. Not only can we learn from hybrid zones about the mechanisms of speciation and how reproductive isolation is maintained, but we can also study their impact on evolutionary processes. Thanks to the advent of next-generation sequencing, we are now able to gain new insight into the structure of hybrid genomes and the factors influencing the outcome of hybridisation. Here, we focus on the Kimbe Bay hybrid zone, a narrow region in the Pacific Ocean where two species of clownfish - Amphiprion chrysopterus and A. sandaracinos - hybridise and give rise to the hybrid A. leucokranos. Based on whole-genome sequencing, we found that the hybrid zone is mainly composed of first-generation hybrids, the first evidence of F2 hybrids in the wild and early backcrosses with A. sandaracinos. The recurrent backcrossing with one of the parental species might lead to adaptive introgression, with few adaptive introgressed loci from A. chrysopterus integrated into the A. sandaracinos genomic background. This study builds upon the growing literature body relative to the evolutionary outcomes of hybridisation and its importance in the evolution of many species.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.03.10.584293,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EVIXSYDutFZGh9SMF32IflUBJaCmt9sAherOPOJ0jtejBg?e=toWlCe

Positive selection","Clownfishes are an iconic group of coral reef fishes that evolved a mutualistic interaction with sea anemones, which triggered the rapid diversification of the group. Following the emergence of this mutualism, clownfishes diversified into different ecological niches and developed convergent phenotypes associated with their host use. The genetic basis of the initial acquisition of the mutualism with host anemones has been described, but the genomic architecture underlying clownfish diversification once the mutualism was established and the extent to which clownfish phenotypic convergence originated through shared genetic mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we investigated these questions by performing comparative genomic analyses on the available genomic data of five pairs of closely related but ecologically divergent clownfish species. We found that clownfish diversification was characterized by bursts of transposable elements, an overall accelerated coding evolution, incomplete lineage sorting, and ancestral hybridization events. Additionally, we detected a signature of positive selection in 5.4% of the clownfish genes. Among them, five presented functions associated with social behavior and ecology, and they represent candidate genes involved in the evolution of the size-based hierarchical social structure so particular to clownfishes. Finally, we found genes with patterns of either relaxation or intensification of purifying selection and signals of positive selection linked with clownfish ecological divergence, suggesting some level of parallel evolution during the diversification of the group. Altogether, this work provides the first insights into the genomic substrate of clownfish adaptive radiation and integrates the growing collection of studies investigating the genomic mechanisms governing species diversification.",https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evad088,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/ETlLtN_mCe5Lk2ZywDbdOPgBSyEryq_Jpueoq8W_rgZcZw?e=rbGIQe
S_speciation,Exploring the macroevolutionary signature of asymmetric inheritance at speciation,"Théo Gaboriau, Joseph A Tobias, Daniele Silvestro, Nicolas Salamin","Phylogenetic Comparative Methods,
Phenotypic evolution,
Speciation,
Character displacement","Popular comparative phylogenetic models such as Brownian Motion, Ornstein-Ulhenbeck, and their extensions, assume that, at speciation, a trait value is inherited identically by the two descendant species. This assumption contrasts with models of speciation at the micro-evolutionary scale where phenotypic distributions of the descendants are sub-samples of the ancestral distribution. Various described mechanisms of speciation can lead to a displacement of the ancestral phenotypic mean among descendants and an asymmetric inheritance of the ancestral phenotypic variance. In contrast, even macro-evolutionary models that account for intraspecific variance assume symmetrically conserved inheritance of the ancestral phenotypic distribution at speciation. Here we develop an Asymmetric Brownian Motion model (ABM) that relaxes the hypothesis of symmetric and conserved inheritance of the ancestral distribution at the time of speciation. The ABM jointly models the evolution of both intra- and inter-specific phenotypic variation. It also allows the mode of phenotypic inheritance at speciation to be inferred, ranging from a symmetric and conserved inheritance, where descendants inherit the ancestral distribution, to an asymmetric and displaced inheritance, where descendants inherit divergent phenotypic means and variances. To demonstrate this model, we analyze the evolution of beak morphology in Darwin finches, finding evidence of character displacement at speciation. The ABM model helps to bridge micro- and macro-evolutionary models of trait evolution by providing a more robust framework for testing the effects of ecological speciation, character displacement, and niche partitioning on trait evolution at the macro-evolutionary scale.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.02.28.530448,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EVl5g3aVUFZBrCyBvDIsVIUBwg1m8uQWlOLI4tvS6eOCvA?e=T8TB2U

As such, integrating biotic interactions into ecological niche modelling methods has been a central topic of research for the last decade. Yet, the role of biotic interactions remains overlooked. Mutualistic systems constitute perfect study cases for analysing the effect of biotic interactions on species niches and communities’ composition.

Methods We integrate mutualistic interactions into a niche quantification framework to analyse the effect of biotic interactions in the estimation of species niches, and competition patterns among clownfish communities.

Results Implementing biotic interactions in ecological niche modelling can improve the reliability of niche estimations, especially in specialist species. Additionally, resource partitioning decreases niche overlap among clownfishes allowing coexistence in species-rich habitats.

Main conclusions We provide a framework to estimate the effects of species interactions and demonstrate the importance of including biotic interaction to improve the estimation of species’ ecological niches. Finally, we show how resource partitioning regulates competition and provides the ecological basis to explain why clownfishes have different sets of associations with sea anemones. The variety of mutualistic strategies serves to ecosystem sustainability, reducing the effect of saturation by species richness and competitive exclusion. Competition avoidance through resource partitioning may be the primary mechanism that shapes clownfish communities across the Indo-Pacific. These findings strongly support the importance of biotic interactions in shaping communities. Future studies could use the proposed analytical framework to serve multiple conservation purposes.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.03.30.534900,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EXDj62FSqmpKljj4XUGuTioBJM6NlQaM4ufz8Lzq37b72Q?e=fciyHv
S_metabolomic,Divergence in metabolomic profile in clownfish and damselfish skin mucus,"Sara Heim, Tony Teav, Hector Gallart-Ayala, Julijana Ivanisevic, Nicolas Salamin","clownfish, damselfish, metabolomics, lipidomics, molecular profiling, chemical signature","Introduction: The clownfish - sea anemone mutualism was suggested to have triggered the adaptive radiation of clownfishes, but the origin of clownfish resistance to stinging tentacles of host anemones remains unclear. The presence of specific compounds in the mucus of clownfishes conferring them the unique ability to prevent nematocyst discharge from their hosts has been the most supported hypothesis. Yet the mystery regarding the types of compounds found in clownfish skin mucus remains unsolved.

Methods: We analyzed the chemical composition of clownfish and damselfish mucus using an untargeted metabolomics (HILIC-HRMS) and lipidomics (RPLC-HRMS) approach.

Results and Discussion: The polar and lipid metabolome signatures were highly specific and allowed to discriminate between the clownfish and damselfish clades. The most discriminative part of the signature was the sphingolipid profile, displaying a broader diversity of ceramides present in significantly higher levels in clownfish mucus. Importantly, the inter-specific variability of metabolic signature was significantly higher in clownfishes, although their diversification is evolutionarily more recent, thus implying the impact of symbiosis on metabolic variability and adaptation. Furthermore, specialists and generalists clownfish species displayed distinctive metabolite signature. Two strict clownfish specialists, which are phylogenetically distant but share the same host species, clustered together based on their molecular signature, suggesting a link with their mutualistic nature. Overall, comparative analyses of metabolic signatures highlight differences in chemical composition of clownfish mucus and provide insight into biochemical pathways potentially implicated in clownfish adaptation to inhabit sea anemones and consequently diversify.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1050083,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/Ebftaz5jWUJPq95B_pwff4MBmvq0yWkaDEQbKFqJa83-kQ?e=g4FxVC

Generalist","Even seemingly homogeneous on the surface, the oceans display high environmental heterogeneity across space and time. Indeed, different soft barriers structure the marine environment, which offers an appealing opportunity to study various evolutionary processes such as population differentiation and speciation. Here, we focus on Amphiprion clarkii (Actinopterygii; Perciformes), the most widespread of clownfishes that exhibits the highest colour polymorphism. Clownfishes can only disperse during a short pelagic larval phase before their sessile adult lifestyle, which might limit connectivity among populations, thus facilitating speciation events. Consequently, the taxonomic status of A. clarkii has been under debate. We used whole-genome resequencing data of 67 A. clarkii specimens spread across the Indian and Pacific Oceans to characterise the species’ population structure, demographic history, and colour polymorphism. We found that A. clarkii spread from the Indo-Pacific Ocean to the Pacific and Indian Oceans following a stepping-stone dispersal and that gene flow was pervasive throughout its demographic history. Moreover, edge populations exhibited more similar colouration patterns compared to central populations. However, we demonstrate that colour polymorphism is not associated with population structure, thus, colour phenotype is unreliable in assessing the taxonomic status of A. clarkii. Our study further highlights the power of whole-genome comparative studies to determine the taxonomy of geographically wide-ranging and phenotypically diverse species, supporting the status of A. clarkii as a single species.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.19.563036,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EWDben0L8qVJk8j_syJgQxIBYJfBRcELjxOx5aVipHt-2Q?e=ppRySJ

Population genetics","To quantify selection acting on a trait, methods have been developed using either within or between-species variation. However, methods using within-species variation do not integrate the changes at the macro-evolutionary scale. Conversely, current methods using between-species variation usually discard within-species variation, thus not accounting for processes at the micro-evolutionary scale. The main goal of this study is to define a neutrality index for a quantitative trait, by combining within- and between-species variation. This neutrality index integrates nucleotide polymorphism and divergence for normalizing trait variation. As such, it does not require estimation of population size nor of time of speciation for normalization. Our index can be used to seek deviation from the null model of neutral evolution, and test for diversifying selection. Applied to brain mass and body mass at the mammalian scale, we show that brain mass is under diversifying selection. Finally, we show that our test is not sensitive to the assumption that population sizes, mutation rates and generation time are constant across the phylogeny, and automatically adjust for it.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.02.559886 ,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EWkpzIpbO0hOvdolmynmKJgBM68hPal6oyFLBOfWz1Vh-w?e=1ALjvV

Rate of evolution
Simulations","Models have always been central to inferring molecular evolution and to reconstructing phylogenetic trees. Their use typically involves the development of a mechanistic framework reflecting our understanding of the underlying biological processes, such as nucleotide substitutions, and the estimation of model parameters by maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. However, deriving and optimizing the likelihood of the data is not always possible under complex evolutionary scenarios or tractable for large datasets, often leading to unrealistic simplifying assumptions in the fitted models. To overcome this issue, we couple stochastic simulations of genome evolution with a new supervised deep learning model to infer key parameters of molecular evolution. Our model is designed to directly analyze multiple sequence alignments and estimate per-site evolutionary rates and divergence, without requiring a known phylogenetic tree. The accuracy of our predictions matches that of likelihood-based phylogenetic inference, when rate heterogeneity follows a simple gamma distribution, but it strongly exceeds it under more complex patterns of rate variation, such as codon models. Our approach is highly scalable and can be efficiently applied to genomic data, as we show on a dataset of 26 million nucleotides from the clownfish clade. Our simulations also show that the per-site rates obtained by deep learning increase the likelihood of the true tree and could therefore lead to more accurate phylogenetic inference. We propose that future advancements in phylogenetic analysis will benefit from a semi-supervised learning approach that combines deep-learning estimation of substitution rates, which allows for more flexible models of rate variation, and probabilistic inference of the phylogenetic tree, which guarantees interpretability and a rigorous assessments of statistical support.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.08.556821,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EURm_9MUQPNJqZiNwzO7lb4BhENsxNlE33I4MCrV0oJIsw?e=hu182T

Codon models","Mutations can be beneficial by bringing innovation to their bearer, allowing them to adapt to environmental change. However, mutations can also be beneficial because they are reverting previous deleterious changes, simply restoring pre-existing functions. By integrating phylogenomic and population data in mammals, we estimated the contribution of beneficial back-mutations to molecular evolution, which had remained widely overlooked so far. Applying a mutation-selection model, we estimated amino acid fitness landscapes for mammalian protein-coding genes. Assuming these fitness landscapes do not change, any beneficial mutation is necessarily a back-mutation. We confirmed that these beneficial back-mutations are positively selected in extant populations and demonstrated that a substantial part of ongoing positive selection is not driven by adaptation to environmental change.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.03.538864,https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/thibault_latrille_unil_ch/EZ-OKk7AGKFHtCJiUMz0rrUBUvpOieR_qfek_5cPGeaaSA?e=Rm46Rd
