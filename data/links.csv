Deepak,M_imputation,"Due to postmortem DNA degradation and microbial colonization, most ancient genomes have low depth of coverage, hindering genotype calling. Genotype imputation can improve genotyping accuracy for low-coverage genomes. However, it is unknown how accurate ancient DNA imputation is and whether imputation introduces bias to downstream analyses. Here we re-sequence an ancient trio (mother, father, son) and downsample and impute a total of 43 ancient genomes, including 42 high-coverage (above 10x) genomes. We assess imputation accuracy across ancestries, time, depth of coverage, and sequencing technology. We find that ancient and modern DNA imputation accuracies are comparable. When downsampled at 1x, 36 of the 42 genomes are imputed with low error rates (below 5%) while African genomes have higher error rates. We validate imputation and phasing results using the ancient trio data and an orthogonal approach based on Mendel’s rules of inheritance. We further compare the downstream analysis results between imputed and high-coverage genomes, notably principal component analysis, genetic clustering, and runs of homozygosity, observing similar results starting from 0.5x coverage, except for the African genomes. These results suggest that, for most populations and depths of coverage as low as 0.5x, imputation is a reliable method that can improve ancient DNA studies.",S_trait_evolution,"To quantify selection acting on a trait, methods have been developed using either within or between-species variation. However, methods using within-species variation do not integrate the changes at the macro-evolutionary scale. Conversely, current methods using between-species variation usually discard within-species variation, thus not accounting for processes at the micro-evolutionary scale. The main goal of this study is to define a neutrality index for a quantitative trait, by combining within- and between-species variation. This neutrality index integrates nucleotide polymorphism and divergence for normalizing trait variation. As such, it does not require estimation of population size nor of time of speciation for normalization. Our index can be used to seek deviation from the null model of neutral evolution, and test for diversifying selection. Applied to brain mass and body mass at the mammalian scale, we show that brain mass is under diversifying selection. Finally, we show that our test is not sensitive to the assumption that population sizes, mutation rates and generation time are constant across the phylogeny, and automatically adjust for it.",Both deal with population genetics,4,
